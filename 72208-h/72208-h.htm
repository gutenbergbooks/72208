<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br><br>
THE MAN ON THE CAIRN
</h3>

<p>
Fifty years ago a wild and stormy sky spread above the
gorges of Lyd, and the vale was flooded in silver mist,
dazzling by contrast with the darkness round about.  Great
welter of vapour, here radiant, here gloomy, obscured the
sinking sun; but whence he shone, vans of wet light fell
through the tumultuous clouds, and touched into sudden,
humid, and luminous brilliancy the forests and hills beneath.
</p>

<p>
A high wind raged along the sky and roared over the
grave-crowned bosom of White Hill on Northern Dartmoor.
Before it, like an autumn leaf, one solitary soul
appeared to be blown.  Beheld from afar, he presented an
elongated spot driven between earth and air; but viewed
more closely, the man revealed unusual stature and great
physical strength.  The storm was not thrusting him before
it; accident merely willed that the wind and he should be
fellow-travellers.
</p>

<p>
Grey cairns of the stone heroes of old lie together on
the crest of White Hill, and the man now climbed one of
these heaps of granite, and stood there, and gazed upon an
immense vision outspread easterly against oncoming night.
It was as though the hours of darkness, tramping lowly
in the sun's wake, had thrown before them pioneers of
cloud.  Two ranges of jagged tors swept across the
skyline and rose, grey and shadowy, against the purple of the
air.  Already their pinnacles were dissolved into gloom,
and from Great Links, the warden of the range, right
and left to lower elevations, the fog banks rolled and crept
along under the naked shoulders of the hills.  Over this
huge amphitheatre the man's eyes passed; then, where
Ger Tor lifts its crags above Tavy, another spirit was
manifest, and evidences of humanity became apparent upon the
fringes of the Moor.  Here trivial detail threaded the
confines of inviolate space; walls stretched hither and thither;
a scatter of white dots showed where the sheep roamed;
and, at valley-bottom, a mile under the barrows of White
Hill, folded in peace, with its crofts and arable land about
it, lay a homestead.  Rounded clumps of beech and sycamore
concealed the dwelling; the farm itself stood at the apex
of a triangle, whose base widened out into fertile regions
southerly.  Meadows, very verdant after hay harvest,
extended here, and about the invisible house stood ricks,
out-buildings, that glimmered cold as water under corrugated
iron roofs, and a glaucous patch of garden green, where
flourished half an acre of cabbage.  One field had geese
upon it; in another, two horses grazed.  A leat drawn from
Tavy wound into the domains of the farm, and a second
rivulet fell out of the Moor beside it.  Cows were being
driven into the yard.  An earth-coloured man tended them,
and a black and white speck raced violently about in their
rear.  A dog's faint barking might be heard upon the hill
when the wind lulled.
</p>

<br>
THE CAIRNS ON WHITE HILL
</p>

<p>
The contrast between the ambient desolation and this
sequestered abode of human life impressed itself upon the
spectator's slow mind.  Again he ranged the ring of hills
with his eyes; then lowered them to Ruddyford Farm.
Despite the turmoil of the hour and the hum and roar of
the wind; despite the savage glories of a silver sunset
westerly and the bleak and leaden aspect of the east; despite
the rain that now touched his nape coldly and flogged the
forgotten tomb on which he stood; this man's heart was
warm, and he smiled into the comfortable valley and nodded
his head with appreciation.
</p>

<p>
The rain and the wind had been his companions from
childhood; the sunshine and the seasons belonged to him
as environment of daily life.  He minded the manifestations
of nature as little as the ponies that now scampered past
him in a whinnying drove; he was young and as yet knew
no pain; he regarded the advent of winter without fear, and
welcomed the equinox of autumn as indifferently as the
first frost or the spring rain.  These things only concerned
him when they bore upon husbandry and the business of
life.
</p>

<p>
Now, like a map rolled out before his eyes, lay the man's
new home and extended the theatre of his future days.
Upon this great stage he would move henceforth, pursue
hope, fulfil destiny, and perchance win the things that he
desired to win.
</p>

<p>
The accidents of wind and storm surrounding this introduction
did not influence the newcomer or affect his mind.
Intensity and rare powers of faith belonged to him; but
imagination was little indicated in his character.  His
interest now poured out upon the cultivated earth spread
below, and had his actual future habitation been visible
instead of hidden, it had not attracted him.  That behind
the sycamores there stood a roof-tree henceforth to shield
his head, mattered nothing; that within its walls were now
congregated his future master and companions, did not
impress itself upon his thoughts.  He was occupied with the
fertile acres, now fading into night, and with the cattle that
pastured round about upon the Moor.  Familiar with the face
of the earth seen afar off, he calculated to a few tons what
hay had recently been saved here, appreciated certain
evidences of prosperity, as revealed by the aspect and position
of the fields; noted with satisfaction the marks of
agricultural wisdom; frowned at signs that argued other views
than his own.
</p>

<p>
He pictured himself at work, longed to be at it, yearned
for outlets to his great, natural energies and vigorous bent
of mind.  Death had thrown him into the market of men,
and, after three months' idleness, he found a new task,
on a part of the Moor remote from his former labours.  But
the familiar aspects of the waste attracted him irresistibly.
He rejoiced to return, to feel the heath under his feet, and
see the manner of his future toil clearly written under his
eyes.  It seemed to him that Ruddyford, with its garden,
tenements, and outlying fields, was but an unfinished thing
waiting for his sure hand to complete.  He would strengthen
the walls, widen the borders, heighten the welfare of this
farm.  No glance backward into the glories of the sunset
did he give, for he was young.  The peace of Lydford's
woodland glades and the lush, low lands beneath, drew
no desire from him.  Villages, hamlets, and the gregarious
life of them, attracted him not at all.  The sky to live
under, a roof to sleep under, Dartmoor to work upon: these
were the things that he found precious at this season.  And
Fate had granted them all.
</p>

<p>
Clouds touched his face coldly; the nightly mists swept
down and concealed the hills and valleys spread between.
For a moment Ruddyford peeped, like a picture, from a
frame of cobweb colour.  Then it was hidden by sheets
of rain.
</p>

<p>
The man leapt off the grave of that other man, whose
ashes in the morning of days had here been buried.  So
long had he stood motionless that it seemed as though a
statue, set up to some vanished hero, grew suddenly
incarnate, and, animated by the spirit of the mighty dead, now
hastened from this uplifted loneliness down into the
highways of life.
</p>

<p>
A fierce torrent scourged the hill as the traveller hurried
from it.  He was drenched before he reached the farmhouse
door.  A dog ran out and growled and showed its teeth at
him.  Then, in answer to his knock, an old man came
slowly down the stone-paved passage.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, you'll be Mr. Daniel Brendon, no doubt?  Your
box was fetched up from Mary Tavy this marning.  You
catched that scat o' rain, I'm afraid.  Come in an'
welcome, an' I'll show you where you'm to lie."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br><br>
RUDDYFORD
</h3>

<p>
A feature of Devon are those cultivated peninsulas of
land that thrust forward up the surrounding coombs and
point into Dartmoor's bosom.  The foothills of this great
tableland are fledged with forests and rich with fertile earth;
but here and there, greatly daring, the farms have fought
upward and reclaimed a little of the actual desolation.
</p>

<p>
Ruddyford was driven like a wedge into that stony
wilderness beneath the Moor's north-western ramparts.  White
Hill sheltered it from the west; the flank of Ger Tor sloped
easterly; to the south flowed Tavy through fertile tilth, grey
hamlets, and green woods.  Only northward was little
immediate shelter; and upon the north Daniel Brendon opened
his eyes when dawned the first day of his new life.
</p>

<p>
His chamber window showed him the glitter of a soaking
world spread under grey of dawn.  His little room was
sparsely furnished, and the whitewashed walls were naked.
He dressed, prayed, then turned to a wooden box and
unpacked his few possessions.  He stowed his clothes in a
yellow chest-of-drawers with white china handles; his desk
he put in the window, on a deep sill, the breadth of the wall.
His boots and a pair of felt slippers he placed in a row.  Some
pictures remained.  One represented his father and mother,
both six years dead.  The photograph was smeared with
yellow, but the stain had missed the faces.  An old, dogged
man, in his Sunday black, sat in a chair and stared stolidly
at the beholder; beside him stood a thin, tall woman of
anxious eyes and gentle mouth.  The face of the man
explained the expression of his wife.  This picture Daniel
hung up on a nail; and beside it he placed another&mdash;the
portrait of his only sister.  There had been but two of
them.  His sister resembled her mother, and was married
to a small tradesman at Plymouth.  Her health caused
Daniel uneasiness, for it was indifferent.  Lastly, from the
bottom of his box, he took an illuminated text, and set it
over the head of his bed.  His father had given it to him.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wisdom."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Daniel often reflected that at least he might claim the
beginning of wisdom, for greatly he feared.
</p>

<p>
Outwardly Brendon was well made, and handsome on a
mighty scale.  If he ever gloried it was in his strength.
He stood four inches over six feet, yet, until another was
placed beside him, did not appear very tall, by reason of
his just proportions.  He was a brown man with small,
triangular whiskers and a moustache that he cut straight
across his lip, like a tooth-brush.  The cropped hair on
his face spoilt it, for the features were finely moulded, and,
in repose, revealed something of the large, soulless, physical
beauty of a Greek statue of youth.  His mind, after the
manner of huge men, moved slowly.  His eyes were of the
character of a dog's: large, brown, innocent, and trustful,
yet capable of flashing into passionate wrath or smouldering
with emotion.
</p>

<p>
A noise, that Daniel made in hammering up his text,
brought somebody to the door.  It was the man who had
welcomed him overnight, and he entered the newcomer's
private chamber without ceremony.
</p>

<p>
"Hold on, my son!" he said.  "You'll wake master,
then us shall all have a very unrestful day.  Mr. Woodrow
be a poor sleeper, like his faither afore him, and mustn't be
roused till half after seven.  He bides in the room below
this, so I hope as you'll always go about so gentle of a
morning as your gert bulk will let 'e."
</p>

<p>
"So I will then," said Daniel.  "'Tis lucky I've been
moving wi'out my boots.  I tread that heavy, Mr. Prout."
</p>

<p>
Old John Prout looked with admiration and some envy
at the young man.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a great gift of Providence to have such a fine body
and such power of arm.  But things be pretty evenly
divided, when you've wit to see all round 'em.  You'll
have to go afoot all your life; no horse will ever carry
you."
</p>

<p>
Daniel laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Nought but a cart-horse, for sartain.  But my own
legs be very good to travel upon."
</p>

<p>
"Without a doubt&mdash;now; wait till you'm up my age.
Then the miles get dreadful long if you've got to trust
to your feet.  I've my own pony here, and I should
be no more use than the dead branch of a tree without
him."
</p>

<p>
The withered but hard old man looked round Daniel's
room.  He had lived all his life at Ruddyford; he was a
bachelor, and devoted his life to his master.  Reynold
Woodrow, the present farmer's father, Prout had obeyed,
but secretly disliked.  Hilary Woodrow, the living owner
of Ruddyford, he worshipped with devoutness and
profoundly admired.  The man could do no wrong in his
servant's eyes.
</p>

<p>
Now John regarded Daniel's text, where it shone with
tarnished crimson and gold.
</p>

<p>
"You'm a religious man, then?"
</p>

<p>
"I hope so."
</p>

<p>
"Well, why not?  For my part, I like to see the chaps
go to church or chapel of a Sunday.  Master don't go, but
he's no objection to it.  He'd so soon have a Roman as
a Plymouth Brother, so long as they stood to work weekdays
and earned their money.  'Tis a tidy tramp to worship,
however."
</p>

<p>
"Why, Lydford ban't above four miles."
</p>

<p>
"That's the distance.  As for me, I don't say I'm not
right with God, for I hope that I am.  But, touching
outward observances, I don't follow 'em.  More do
Mr. Woodrow, though a better man never had a bad cough."
</p>

<p>
"I'd fear to face a day's work until I'd gone on my
knees," declared Brendon, without self-consciousness.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! at my time of life, us bow the heart rather than
the knee&mdash;specially if the rheumatics be harboured at that
joint, as in my case.  But a very fine text for a bed-head,
'The fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wisdom.'  And I'll
tell you another thing.  The love of the Lord is the end
of it.  That ban't in the Bible, yet a living word as my life
have taught me.  I go my even way and ban't particular
about prayer, nor worship, nor none of that.  And as for
the bread and wine, I haven't touched 'em for a score of
years; yet I love the Lord an' trust Him, for all the world
like a babby trusts its mother's breast for breakfast.  'Tis an
awful simple religion."
</p>

<p>
"Simple enough to lose your salvation, I should reckon.
If you believe, you did ought to tremble.  'Tis for God
A'mighty to love you, not for you to love Him so loud,
and yet do nought to show it.  No prayers, no sacrament,
no worship&mdash;what's that but to be a heathen man&mdash;begging
your pardon?"
</p>

<p>
"You'll see different if you stop along of us.  'Tis a
good working faith that breeds my peace of mind and
master's.  My fault is that I'm too easy with you chaps.
Even the dogs know what a soft old silly I be."
</p>

<p>
Brendon considered this confession, and it brought him
to a subject now upon his mind.
</p>

<p>
"What's my job exactly?  How do I stand?  I'd hoped
to have a bit of authority myself here, along of my good
papers."
</p>

<p>
"Farmer will tell 'e all about that after his breakfast.
The things[<a id="chap0102fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0102fn1">1</a>] will be your job, I suppose.  But he'll explain
himself.  He's made of kindness, yet no common sort of
man.  Them as know him would go through fire an' water
for him.  However, 'tis an art to know him, and only comes
with patience."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0102fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap0102fn1text">1</a>] <i>Things</i>.  Cattle.  A moor-man always speaks of 'things' when he

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Not married?"
</p>

<p>
"No, nor like to be.  He offered hisself to a cat-hearted
minx down to Peter Tavy; and she took him; and 'twas
all settled.  Then there comed along, a cousin of hers, who
has a linen-draper's shop near London, and be damned if
she didn't change her mind!  It set Hilary Woodrow against
women, as well it might.  There's only one female in this
house, and you can hardly say she's a woman.  Merely a
voice and a pair of eyes and a pair of hands, and a few
bones tied up in a petticoat.  My sister, Tabitha&mdash;as good
a soul as ever fretted a houseful of males.  'Bachelors'
Hall' they call this place down to Lydford.  And so 'tis,
for only the ploughman, Joe Tapson, have ever been
married; and he'll tell you plainly, without false feeling,
that the day that made him a widow-man, was the first he
ever thanked his God for."
</p>

<p>
A thin voice came up the stairs.
</p>

<p>
"John&mdash;breaksis!"
</p>

<p>
"Come to breakfast," said Mr. Prout.  "Then I'll walk
around the place with 'e, afore the master be ready."
</p>

<p>
So dull was the dawn, that firelight shone in the polished
surfaces of the kitchen, and its genial glow made the morning
chill and lifeless by contrast.
</p>

<p>
Three men already sat at the table, and John Prout took
the head of it.  The newcomer was listened to with courtesy,
and his extraordinary size won him open admiration.
</p>

<p>
"A good big un's the best that woman breeds," said
the widower, Tapson.  He was himself a man somewhat
undersized.  He had but one eye, a wrinkled brown skin,
and a little goat-beard; but the rest of his face was shaved
clean once a week&mdash;on Sunday morning.
</p>

<p>
"No tender spot?" he asked.  "So often you gert
whackers have a soft place somewhere that brings you down
to the level of common men when it comes to work.  'Tis
the heart gets tired most often, along wi' the power o'
pumping the blood to the frame."
</p>

<p>
"No weak spot that I know about, thank God," said
Daniel.
</p>

<p>
"Us'll have to get up a wraslin' bout betwixt you and
the 'Infant,'" declared another labourer, called Agg.  He
was a red man of average size, with a pleasant and simple
countenance.
</p>

<p>
"The 'Infant's' a chap to Lydford," he explained.  "He
was at a shop up in London, but got home-sick an' come
back to the country.  Very near so large as you be."
</p>

<p>
"I know about him," answered Brendon.  "'Tis William
Churchward, the schoolmaster's son.  There's a bit more
of him below the waist than what there is of me; but I'm
a lot harder and I stand two inch taller."
</p>

<p>
"You could throw him across the river," said Joe
Tapson.
</p>

<p>
There came a knock at the door while breakfast
progressed, and a girl appeared.  She was a wild-looking,
rough-haired little thing of sixteen.  She entered with great
self-possession, took off her sunbonnet, shook her black hair
out of her eyes, and set down a large round bundle in a
red handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
The men laughed; Miss Prout's voice rose to its highest
cadences, and her thin shape swayed with indignation.
</p>

<p>
"Again, Susan!  Twice in two months.  'Tis beyond
belief, and a disgrace to the family!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Aunt Tab, who wouldn't?  Last night Aunt
Hepsy didn't give me no supper, because I dropped the
salt-cellar in the apple-tart&mdash;a thing anybody might do.  And
I'm leery as a hawk, so I am."
</p>

<p>
"There's no patience in you," grumbled Mr. Prout's
sister.  "Why for can't you understand the nature of
your Aunt Hepsy, and make due allowances for it?  Such
a trollop as you&mdash;such a fuzzy-poll, down-at-heels maid&mdash;be
the very one to drive her daft.  'Twas a Christian act
to take you&mdash;friendless orphan that you be; but as to
service&mdash;how you think you'll ever rise to it, I can't say."
</p>

<p>
Susan's uncle had given her some breakfast, and she ate
heartily, and showed herself quite at home.
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Hepsy's always a bit kinder after I've runned
away, however," exclaimed the girl; "that is, after she've
told me what she thinks about me."
</p>

<p>
Daniel Brendon observed Susan closely, for she sat on
a kitchen form beside him at Mr. Prout's right hand.  A
neat little budding shape she had, and small brown hands,
like a monkey's.
</p>

<p>
Presently she looked up at him inquiringly.
</p>

<p>
"This here's Mr. Brendon," explained Agg.  Then he
turned to Daniel.
</p>

<p>
"The maiden be Mr. Prout's niece, you must know.
She's with the family of Weekes to Lydford, learning to
get clever for sarvice.  But she'm always running
away&mdash;ban't you, Susan?  Here's the mustard to your bacon, my
dear."
</p>

<p>
"I run away when I'm that pushed," explained Susan,
with her mouth full.  "'Tis a lesson to 'em.  I wouldn't
run from Uncle Weekes, for a kinder man never lives; but
Aunt Hepsy's different."
</p>

<p>
"For that matter, I dare say Phil Weekes would be
jolly glad to run along with you sometimes, if he could,"
said Tapson.  But the remark annoyed Miss Prout, and
she reproved him sharply.
</p>

<p>
"You'll do better to mind your own affairs, Joe.  Ban't
no business of yours to talk rude about other people's
families; an' I'll thank you not to do so.  No man ever
had a better wife than Philip Weekes have got; which I
say, though she is my own flesh and blood; and 'tis a very
improper thing all you men siding with this here silly
little toad; and you ought to stop it, John, as well you
know."
</p>

<p>
"So I ought," admitted Mr. Prout.  "Now, up an'
away.  And, after dinner, I be going into Lydford, so you
can come back along wi' me, Susan."
</p>

<p>
"Let me bide one day," pleaded the girl.  "Then I
can help Aunt Tab wi' the washing."
</p>

<p>
"Right well you know the time to come here, you
cunning wench!" said her aunt.  "Some of these days,
Susie, Hephzibah Weekes won't take 'e back at all.  Her
patience ban't her first virtue, as you ought to know by
this time."
</p>

<p>
"So I do.  But her power of keeping money in her
pocket be.  She'll always take me back, because I'm the
only maiden as she'll ever get for nought.  She says I ought
to pay her!"
</p>

<p>
"So you ought, if you could.  Didn't you go to her
after your mother died, wi'out a smurry to your back?
There's no gratitude in girls nowadays.  Well, you can
bide till to-morrow; and, so soon as you've done, you'd best
to light wash-house fire, while I clear up."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Brendon walked round Ruddyford presently with the head
man, and saw much to admire and not a little to regret.
He longed to be at work that he might reveal his modern
principles and knowledge; but Mr. Prout was not much
impressed by Daniel's opinions, and showed a stout,
conservative spirit.
</p>

<p>
"You'm a great man for new-fangled notions, I see,"
he remarked.  "Well, you must tell master 'bout it.  For
my part, I've made up my mind on most questions of
farming by now, and can't change no more.  But he'll
hear you.  Trust him for that.  He hears us all with
wonderful large patience for a young man of his age.  I'm
glad you like the place.  'Tis a funny old sort of a spot,
but I wouldn't go nowheres else for a hat of money."
</p>

<p>
At ten o'clock Hilary Woodrow came into the kitchen,
where his new man was waiting for him.
</p>

<p>
"Morning, Tabitha,' said the farmer.  Then he turned
to Brendon.
</p>

<p>
"Come this way, please.  We'll talk in the air."
</p>

<p>
They walked together beside the great patch of cabbage
that Daniel had marked from the hills.
</p>

<p>
"Your character was very good, and I'm glad to have
you here," began the farmer.
</p>

<p>
He indicated the work he expected, and the general rules,
hours and regulations of Ruddyford, while Daniel listened
in silence.
</p>

<p>
Hilary Woodrow was a thin man of medium height and
rather refined appearance.  His colour was dark and his
face clearly cut, with small, delicate features.  His voice
was gentle, and an air of lassitude sat upon him, as though
life already tended to weariness.  His age was thirty-five,
but he looked rather more, and a touch of grey already
appeared about the sides of his head.  To Daniel he
appeared a very fragile being, and yet his clear, cold voice
and his choice of words impressed the labourer, though he
knew not why.  Brendon felt that his master possessed a
master's power.  He found himself touching his forelock
instinctively, when the other stopped sometimes and looked
him straight in the face.
</p>

<p>
This secret of strength was built upon dual foundations.
Woodrow possessed a strong will, and he had enjoyed
an unusual education.  His father and mother, fired by
ambition for their only child, had sent him to Tavistock
Grammar School.  Thence he went to London to read law,
but neither the place nor the profession suited him.  He
learnt much, but gladly returned to Dartmoor when his
father died suddenly and left his mother alone.  At her
husband's death, Hester Woodrow's dreams for the boy
instantly crumbled, and she was well content that her son
should succeed Reynold Woodrow and remain beside her.
Hilary's health offered another reason, for London had done
him little good in respect of that.  He was a sensual man.
</p>

<p>
The large events of his life numbered few.  First came
experience of the metropolis; and since one must wither a
while in cities before the full, far-reaching message of
nature can be read, his years in London largely helped to
teach young Woodrow the meaning and the blessing of his
home.  Then fell a father's death; and it awoke him to
experience of grief and the weight of responsibility.
Following upon these enlightenments came love.  He was
accepted, and jilted after the wedding-day had been named.
Lastly, just before his thirtieth birthday, his mother died
and left him alone in the world, for he had no near relations.
Ruddyford was a freehold farm, and now Hilary Woodrow
owned it.  On his mother's death he had felt disposed to
throw up all and travel.  But he found himself uneasy in
mind and body if long absent from the high grounds of the
Moor; and finally he determined to spend his days as his
father had done before him.
</p>

<p>
Much did the Prouts desire a mistress at Ruddyford for
the comfort of everybody concerned there; but Hilary, after
his reverse, held aloof from women.  Indeed, his life was
very solitary for so young a man.  He did not make friends,
and, among his equals, was cold and reserved.  He felt a
little nervous of his health, and showed a sensitiveness to
weather that puzzled the folk who are superior to that
weakness.
</p>

<p>
Thus he stood, at the limits of youth, and gazed ahead
without much enthusiasm or interest.  He found great
pleasure in books and in riding.  He did not smoke, and
drank but little.  His heart was kind, and he performed
good deeds, if they were easy to perform.  His mind was
of a sceptic bent, but he prided himself justly on a generous
tolerance.  Most men liked him and wished that they knew
him better; but he was a character more likely to be
understood by women than men.
</p>

<p>
Daniel Brendon listened to his duties, and found himself
disappointed.  No special department awaited him; no
control was destined to be placed in his hands.  He had
come to help with the rough and varied work of the farm.
It was expected of him to turn his hand to anything and
everything; to take his daily task from John Prout, and to
stand on the same footing as the other labourers.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Prout said something about the beasts," he
explained, slowly.  "'Twas my hope, master, as you'd put a
bit of trust in me, seeing my papers."
</p>

<p>
"I put trust in everybody.  You'll never find a more
trustful man.  It's a secret of farming to trust&mdash;when you
can."
</p>

<p>
"But I had the handling of a power of things at Postbridge."
</p>

<p>
"So you will have with me."
</p>

<p>
"A man an' a boy under my orders, too."
</p>

<p>
Woodrow laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I see.  You'll only have three dogs under your orders
here."
</p>

<p>
"Not that I want&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you do&mdash;we all do.  You'll get power enough,
Brendon, if 'tis in you.  Power comes out of ourselves.  Go
ahead and do your work.  Perhaps, six months hence,
you'll be so powerful that we shall have to part
company&mdash;eh?"
</p>

<p>
"I know my job very well."
</p>

<p>
"Of course you do.  I shouldn't want you otherwise.
If your will is as strong as your legs and arms, you ought
to have a farm of your own before long.  How old are
you?"
</p>

<p>
"Twenty-five, master."
</p>

<p>
"I'd give Ruddyford twice over to have your limbs."
</p>

<p>
"They are so good as yours, while you pay for 'em."
</p>

<p>
"Go ahead, then.  Take a tramp round before dinner,
and see what you think of those heifers up the hill.  I've
had an offer for them, but don't feel quite satisfied.  Tell
me what you reckon they are worth&mdash;taking the whole
five-and-twenty together."
</p>

<p>
In two minutes Daniel was away with a couple of sheepdogs
after him.  He reflected on this, his first piece of
work, and it pleased him.  He was an accurate judge of
stock and knew that he could estimate very closely the value
of the heifers.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br><br>
A THEATRE OF FAILURE
</h3>

<p>
With his thoughts for company Brendon strode upon
an errand to the high Moor.  He had been at Ruddyford a
fortnight, and liked the people, but his master troubled
him, for he did not understand Mr. Woodrow's attitude.
The farmer's silence puzzled Daniel more than hard words
had done.  His consolation was that a like reticence and
apparent indifference were displayed to all.
</p>

<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-016.jpg" alt="THE OLD PEAT WORKS">
<br>
THE OLD PEAT WORKS
</p>

<p>
Now Brendon climbed aloft to the lonely bosom of
Amicombe Hill.  He breasted the eastern shoulder of Great
Links, and then stood a moment, startled by the strangeness
of the scene before him.  This field of industry had already
passed into the catalogue of man's failures upon Dartmoor,
and ruin marked the spot.  Round about, as though torn
by giant ploughs, the shaggy slope of the hill was seamed
and ripped with long lines of darkness.  A broken wall or
two rose here and there, and radiating amid the desolation
of bog and mire, old tramways ran red.  In the midst of
these morasses stood the peat works, like a mass of
simmering, molten metal poured out upon the Moor and left
to rust there.  Low stone buildings with rotten roofs, gleaming
corrugated iron still white, black walls, broken chimneys,
and scattered debris of stone and steel huddled here in
mournful decay.  Everywhere cracked wheels, broken
trolleys, twisted tram-lines, and dilapidated plant, sank into
wreck and rot amid the growing things.  Like a sea the
waste billowed round about and began to swallow and
smother this futile enterprise.  Leaks and cracks gaped
everywhere.  Raw mountains of peat slowly grew green
again under heath and grass and the wild sorrel.  Here
were miles of rusty wire in huge red tangles, that looked as
though the lightning had played at cat's-cradle with them;
here washes of dim and dingy green swept the hills; here
flat liverworts and tumid fungus ate the woodwork like
cancers; here beds of emerald sphagnum swallowed the
old peat-knives and spades.  Sections of the peat laid bare
showed a gradual change in quality, from the tough and
fibrous integument of heather-root and grass, to a pure cake,
growing heavier and darker, until, two yards from the
surface, it was inky black and soft as butter.  From six to ten
feet of this fuel spread in a layer of many million tons over
the granite bones of Amicombe Hill.  Immense quantities were
already removed, but the enterprise failed utterly, and the
great hill, where so much of sanguine toil had been
expended, still stretched under the sky with little more than
scratches on its face.
</p>

<p>
Brendon approached this cemetery of hope, to find a
ghost there.  The buildings, dwarfed by distance, soon
towered above him as he reached them, and he found that
they contained huge chambers internally blackened by the
peat, yet illuminated by shafts of outer light that pierced
into them.  Through broken windows and gaping walls day
came, and revealed immense, silent wheels, and bars thrust
out of hollows, and deep pits.  Great pipes stretched from
darkness into darkness again; drums and tanks and forges
stood up about him; mysterious apertures sundered the
walls and gaped in the floors; strange implements appeared;
stacks of peat-cake rose, piled orderly; broken bricks, silent
machinery, hillocks of rubbish and dirt, heaps of metal and
balks of timber loomed together from a dusky twilight, and
choked these stricken and shadowy halls.
</p>

<p>
Dead silence reigned here to Daniel's ears, fresh from the
songs of the wind on the Moor.  But, as his eyes grew
accustomed to the velvety darkness and fitful illumination of
these earth-stained chambers, so his ears also were presently
tuned to the peace of the place.  Then, through the stillness,
there came a sound, like some great creature breathing
in sleep.  It was too regular for the wind, too loud for any
life.  It panted steadily, and the noise appeared to come
from beneath the listener's feet.
</p>

<p>
Daniel lifted his voice, and it thundered and clanged
about him, like a sudden explosion.  A dozen echoes
wakened, and he guessed that no such volume of sound had
rolled through these iron-vaulted chambers since the
machinery ceased.
</p>

<p>
"Be you here, Mr. Friend?" he shouted, and all the
stagnant air rang.
</p>

<p>
No answering voice reached him; but the stertorous
breathing ceased, and presently came the fall of slow feet.
A head rose out of the earth; then it emerged, and a body
and legs followed.
</p>

<p>
"Come down below, will 'e?  I can't leave my work,"
said the apparition; then it sank again, and Brendon followed
it down a flight of wooden steps.  One cracked under his
weight.
</p>

<p>
"Mind what you'm doing," called back the leader.
"They'm rotten as touchwood in places."
</p>

<p>
Below was a forge, which Daniel had heard panting, and
beside it stood retorts and various rough chemical appliances.
The operator returned to his bellows and a great ray of hot,
red light flashed and waned, flashed and waned.
</p>

<p>
Like some ancient alchemist amid his alembics, the older
man now appeared, and his countenance lent aid to the
simile, for it was bearded and harsh and bright of eye.
Gregory Friend might have been sixty, and looked almost
aged under these conditions.  His natural colour was fair,
but a life in the atmosphere of the great fuel-beds had stained
his visible parts to redness.  His very beard, folk said, was
dyed darker than nature.  He stood there, a strange man of
fanatic spirit; and his eyes showed it.  They burnt with
unconquerable hope; they indicated a being to whom some
sort of faith must be the breath of life.  It remained for
Daniel to discover the articles of that faith; and they were
not far to seek.
</p>

<p>
"I be come from Ruddyford," said the labourer.
"Master wants four journeys o' peat, and I was to say
that the carts will be up Tuesday."
</p>

<p>
Friend nodded.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis ready; and a thousand journeys for that matter.
Look here.  The Company have sent these samples from
Wales.  What do 'e think of 'em?"
</p>

<p>
"I ban't skilled in peat," said Daniel.  "It seems all
right."
</p>

<p>
"Not to my eye.  Peat be sent up to me from Scotland
and Wales and Ireland; and I try it with my tools here.
But 'tis trash&mdash;all trash&mdash;alongside our peat.  There's less
tar to it, an' less gas to it, an' less power o' heat to it.  Do
'e see these?"
</p>

<p>
The expert handed Daniel a number of little, heavy,
black cakes, as hard as a brick.
</p>

<p>
"You've made 'em, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis Amicombe peat&mdash;the best in the world.  Better
than coal, you might almost say.  We dry and we powder;
then we build the cakes an' put 'em in thicky press till they
are squeezed as hard as stone.  There's your fuel!  'Twill
smelt iron in the furnace!  What other fashion o' peat but
ours can do it?  None as ever I heard tell about.  Look
at this here tar.  What other peat will give you such stuff?
None&mdash;none but Amicombe Hill.  Millions of tons
waiting&mdash;thousands of pounds of good money lying here under this
heath&mdash;waiting."
</p>

<p>
"And 'twill have to wait, seemingly."
</p>

<p>
"That's the point.  People think the Company's dead.
But it ban't dead.  I've seen the whole history.  I was
among the first they took on.  I helped from the beginning.
It ban't dead, only in low water.  They may start
again&mdash;they must.  'Tis madness to stop now."
</p>

<p>
"You believe in it?"
</p>

<p>
"I'd stake my last shilling in it.  For that matter, I
have done so.  Company owes me fifty pounds less three,
this very minute.  But if the wise ones have their way, I'll
get five hundred for my fifty yet."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Friend's fire had sunk low; into the darkness from
above shot one ray of daylight, blue by contrast with the
gloom of the laboratory.
</p>

<p>
"Come an' have a look at the engine," said the
caretaker.  "'Tis near twenty year since steam was up; and
I've given such watchful heed to it that us might be running
again in a week&mdash;but for a plate here and there that's eaten
away."
</p>

<p>
Brendon had wit to perceive that Mr. Friend's perspective
was distorted in this matter.  As one who lives intimately
with a companion, and cleaves too close to mark the
truth of Time's sure carving on a loved face, so this
enthusiast quite failed to appreciate the real state of the peat
works, or their absolute and utter ruination.
</p>

<p>
The Company indeed lingered, but any likelihood of
reconstruction was remote.  From time to time engineers
appeared upon the scene, made suggestions, and revived
Gregory Friend; but nought came of these visits:
everything remained stationary save the hand of Nature.
</p>

<p>
Daniel praised a fifteen-horse-power engine, which the
guardian of this desolation kept oiled and clean; he heard
the peat expert's story, and discovered that, while Friend's
belief in man had long since perished, his belief in
Amicombe Hill and its hoarded possibilities was boundless and
unshaken.  This shaggy monster, heather-clad, with unctuous
black fen rolling ten feet thick over its granite ribs, was his
God.  He worshipped it, ministered to it, played high priest
to it.  They walked together presently over the shining
ridges where black pools lay and chocolate-coloured cuttings
shone, fringed with the pink bog-heather.  Mr. Friend
thrust his fingers into the peat and reviewed a thousand
great scads, where they stood upright, propped together to
dry.  In Gregory's eyes, as they wandered upon that scene
forlorn, were the reverence of a worshipper and the pride
of a parent.
</p>

<p>
"They've never yet proved it," he said.  "But I have.
Not an acre of these miles but I've tested.  'Tis all good,
right through."
</p>

<p>
"But master was talking a bit ago, and he said that
your peat-cake be more expensive than coals, when all's said."
</p>

<p>
"He's wrong, then.  Ton per ton you could have the
pressed cake for a thought less than coal&mdash;if they'd only
listen to me.  But there 'tis; they'm stiff-necked, and send
down empty fools instead of practical people.  They talk
folly and pocket their cash and go; and nothing comes of
it; and I be left to wait till they hear me.  A sensible man
will happen along presently.  Until then, the place is in
my hands.  Only I and the God that made this here hill,
know what be in it.  China clay, mind you, as well!  I've
showed it to 'em.  I've put it under their noses, but they
won't hearken."
</p>

<p>
"D'you live up here?"
</p>

<p>
"I do&mdash;across to Dunnagoat Cottage.  Us'll go back
that way and I'll give 'e a drink."
</p>

<p>
Friend washed his hands in a pool.  Then he returned
to the works, extinguished his lamp and fire, locked the
outer door of the great chambers, and set off southward
beside Brendon.
</p>

<p>
He learnt the newcomer's name, remarked on his size,
and then returned to peat.  But Daniel was weary of the
subject and strove to change it.
</p>

<p>
"You'm lonely up here, I reckon, an' not another house
for miles," he said.
</p>

<p>
"I keep up here and bide honest," answered Friend.
"If you go down-along among the rogues, your honesty
wears away, an' you never know it have gone, till somebody
stands up to your face and tells you so.  I've seen young
men slide from it without ever meaning to.  As to being
lonely, I've got my darter and my work.  I go to Lydford
once a week for letters.  But a town drives me mad&mdash;all
the noise and business and silly talk."
</p>

<p>
They tramped over coarse fen, spattered with ling and
the ragged white tufts of the cotton grass.  Upon the waste
shone cheerful light, where the blades of rough moor
herbage began to perish from their tips and burn orange-red.
Through the midst ran a pathway on which the gravel of
granite glittered.  Pools extended round about, and beneath
them the infant Rattle-brook, newcome from her cradle
under Hunter Tor, purred southward to Tavy.
</p>

<br>
TAVY CLEEVE.
</p>

<p>
The men followed this stream, and so approached a solitary
grey cottage that stood nakedly in the very heart of the
wilderness.  Stark space surrounded it.  At first sight it
looked no more than a boulder, larger than common, that
had been hurled hither from the neighbouring hill at some
seismic convulsion of olden days.  But, unlike the stones
around it, this lump of lifted granite was hollow, had
windows pierced in its lowly chambers, and a hearth upon
its floor.  It seemed a thing lifted by some sleight of power
unknown, for it rose here utterly unexpected and, as it
appeared, without purpose.  No trace was left of the means
by which it came.  Not a wall, not a bank or alignment
encircled it; no enclosure of any kind approached it; no
outer rampart fenced it from the desolation.  Heather-clad
ridges of peat ran to the very threshold; rough natural
clitters of rock tumbled to its walls; door and windows
opened upon primal chaos, rolling and rising, sinking and
falling in leagues on every side.  Heavy morasses stretched
to north and east; westward rose Dunnagoat Tor, that gave
a name to the cot, and past the entrance Rattle-brook
rippled noisily.  Away, whence morning came, the great
hogged back of Cut Hill swelled skyward, and the towers
and battlements of Fur Tor arose; while southerly, brown,
featureless, interminable undulations drifted along the horizon
and faded upon air, or climbed to the far distant crags and
precipices of Great Mis.
</p>

<p>
The door of Gregory Friend's home faced west; and now
it framed a woman.

Sarah Jane Friend's eyes opened wide to see so mighty
a stranger approaching with her father.  But he was of their
own class, for his raiment proclaimed him.  Therefore the
woman left the doorstep and walked a little way to meet
them.
</p>

<p>
Of purest Saxon type was she.  One might have guessed
that some strain of blood from the Heptarchy had been
handed onward through the centuries, unalloyed with any
Celtic or Norman addition.  So did not the aboriginal
Danmonii look; for the women who herded in the old granite
lodges aforetime and logged the stoneman's babies in a
wolf-skin were swarthy and small.  Sarah Jane stood five feet
ten, and was fair of face.  Her hair shone of the palest gold
that a woman's hair can be; her skin was white.  Only the
summer suns and the wind from the ocean warmed it to
clear redness.  When winter came again and the light was
low, her face grew pale once more.  But pallid it was not.
Health shone in her radiant blue eyes and on her lips.  She
revealed great riches of natural beauty, but they were
displayed to no artificial advantage, and her generous breast
and stately hips went uncontrolled.  She was clad in a
dirty print gown, over which, for apron, hung an old sack
with "Amicombe Peat Works" stamped in faded black
letters across it.  Her sleeves were rolled up; her hair was
wild about her nape.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Friend had found Daniel to his taste, for a steadfast
listener always cheered him and made him amiable.
</p>

<p>
"This be Mr. Daniel Brendon," he said.  "He'm
working to Ruddyford, and comes up with a message.  Give
us a drink o' cider."
</p>

<p>
Sarah nodded, cast a swift glance at the labourer, and
returned to her house.
</p>

<p>
"Won't come in&mdash;I be in such a muck o' dirt," declared
Dan; but the other insisted.
</p>

<p>
"Peat ban't dirt," he said.  "'Tis sweet, wholesome
stuff, an' good anywhere."
</p>

<p>
They sat at a deal table presently, and Gregory's daughter
brought two large stone-ware mugs decorated with black
trees on a blue ground.  She poured out their cider and
spoke to the visitor.
</p>

<p>
"How do 'e like it down-along then, mister?"
</p>

<p>
"Very nice, thank you kindly," he answered, looking
into her eyes and wondering at the colour of them.
</p>

<p>
"John Prout's a good old chap," she said.
</p>

<p>
"So he is, then.  Never met a better."
</p>

<p>
"How his sister can keep all you men in order I don't
know, I'm sure."
</p>

<p>
"She's a very patient creature.  Here's luck, Mr. Friend."
</p>

<p>
He turned to the peat-master and lifted his mug.  Gregory
thanked him.
</p>

<p>
"You'm an understanding chap, seemingly; though
they'm rare in the rising generation.  What's your work to
Ruddyford?"
</p>

<p>
Dan's face fell.
</p>

<p>
"To be plain with you, not all I could wish.  Master
'pears to think a man of my inches can't be no good in the
head.  He puts nought but heavy work upon me&mdash;not that
I mind that, for I can do what it takes two others to
do&mdash;to say it without boasting, being built so.  But I'm an
understanding man, as you be good enough to allow, and
I'd hoped that he'd have seen it, too, and let me have
authority here an' there."
</p>

<p>
"Of course," said Sarah Jane.  "If you can do two
men's work, you ought to have the ordering of people."
</p>

<p>
"But a big arm be nought nowadays, along o' steam
power," he explained.  "I haven't a word against Tapson,
or Agg, or yet Lethbridge: they'm very good fellows all.
But, if I may say so without being thought ill of, they'm
simple men, and want a better man to watch 'em.  Now such
as they would bide here, for instance, and talk the
minute-hand round the clock&mdash;from no badness in them, but just
empty minds."
</p>

<p>
He rose and prepared to go.
</p>

<p>
"Your parts will come to be knowed, if you're skilled in
'em and bide your time," said Mr. Friend; "though if
you balance patience against the shortness of life, 'tis often
a question whether some among us don't push patience too
far.  I've been patient too long for one; but that's because
I can't be nothing else.  I've told 'em the great truth&mdash;God
knows.  But ban't my part to lead.  I must obey.  Yet,
knowing what I know about Amicombe Hill, 'tis hard to
wait.  Sometimes I think the Promised Land ban't for me
at all."
</p>

<p>
"I should hope the Promised Land was for all of us,"
ventured Daniel.
</p>

<p>
"That Land&mdash;yes.  I mean yonder hill, bursting with
fatness."
</p>

<p>
He waved up the valley in the direction of the peat
works.
</p>

<p>
They came to the door and Sarah spoke again.
</p>

<p>
"I should think Mr. Woodrow wouldn't stand in your
way.  He rode up to see father last year, and was a very
kindly man, though rather sorrowful-looking."
</p>

<p>
"He is a kindly man," said Brendon, "and a good
master, which we all allow.  But he'm only half alive, so
to say.  At least, the other half of him be hidden from us.
He'm not one of us, along of his education.  A great reader
of books and a great secret thinker."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure he'll come to know your vartues, if he's such
a clever man as all that," said Sarah Jane frankly.
</p>

<p>
The compliment took Daniel's breath away.  He laughed
foolishly.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis terrible kind of you to say so, and I thank you very
much for them words," he answered.
</p>

<p>
The father eyed them, and saw Mr. Brendon's neck and
cheeks grow red.  The young men often revealed these
phenomena before his daughter's good wishes.  She was
amiable and generous-hearted.  Her exceedingly sequestered
life might have made some women shy; but to her it lent
a candour and unconventional singleness of mind, that
rendered more sophisticated spirits uneasy.  The doors of
her nature were thrown open; she almost thought aloud.
Numerous suitors courted her in consequence, and a clown
or two had erred before Sarah Jane, because they imagined
that her good-natured interest in their affairs must be
significant and special.  Brendon, however, was not the
man to make any such mistake.  He departed, impressed
and flattered at her sympathy; yet his mind did not dwell
upon that.  He sought rather to think a picture of her
young face, and strove to find a just simile for her hair.
He decided that it was the colour of kerning corn, when
first the green fades and the milky grain begins to feel the
kiss of summer.
</p>

<p>
A man cried to him before he had gone more than a
hundred yards from Dunnagoat Cottage, and, rather gladly,
he retraced his steps.  But Sarah Jane had disappeared,
and Mr. Friend was alone.  Gregory advanced to meet him
as he returned.
</p>

<p>
"I like you," said the elder.  "You'm serious-minded
and might wish to hear more about the truth of peat.  What
do you do of a Sunday?"
</p>

<p>
"I go to church mornings; then there's a few odd bits o'
work; but I've nought between three o'clock and supper."
</p>

<p>
"Next Sunday, if the day's fine, I'm going over to
Wattern Oke."
</p>

<p>
"I know the hill."
</p>

<p>
"You can meet me an' my darter there an' have a tell,
if you mind to."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure nothing would please me better, Mr. Friend&mdash;'tis
a very great act of kindness to propose it."
</p>

<p>
Gregory nodded and said no more, while Brendon,
gratified by the invitation, went his way.
</p>

<p>
He had no thought for the immensity of the earth vision
now rolling under his feet.  His eye turned inward to
regard impressions recently registered by memory.  Friend's
strange, peat-smeared face, his shining beard, and wild eyes;
Sarah Jane's neck and shoulders and straight back; her
hands that held the cider-jug; her voice, so kindly&mdash;these
things quite filled the man's slow brain.
</p>

<p>
Of a devout intensity under religious influence, Brendon's
strenuous nature developed less favourably beneath pressure
of mundane affairs.  He could be passionate and he could
be harsh.  He found it uncommonly difficult to forgive
injury, and sometimes sulked before imaginary injustice.  He
was somewhat sensitive and given to brooding.  He knew
his own good qualities, but while too modest to push them,
felt secret sense of wrong when others failed to discover them
swiftly.  Like all men, he delighted to be taken at his own
valuation; but though his humility would not publish that
valuation, yet, when his cause was not advanced, he resented
it and made a grievance of neglect.
</p>

<p>
It was early at present to predict his future at Ruddyford.
The place proceeded automatically.  Nobody was ambitious
of power, or of work; each did his toll of toil, and all were
friends.  Nominally Mr. Prout ruled; in reality the little
commonwealth had no head under the master.  In time of
rare disputes John Prout laid down the law and none
questioned him.  Few difficulties arose, for Woodrow paid
well and kept the farm in a state of culture unusually high.
A very rare standard of comfort prevailed, and neighbours
always held that Hilary Woodrow was rather an amateur,
or gentleman-farmer, than one who lived by his labours and
worked for bread.  But none could say of him that he
neglected his business.  He knew the possibilities of Ruddyford,
spent only upon the land what it was worth, and devoted
the greater part of his money and care to raising of sheep
and cattle.
</p>

<p>
Brendon strode down the great side of Hare Tor, then
suddenly perceiving that he was walking out of his way,
turned right-handed.  The wind blew up rain roughly from
the south, and separate cloud-banks slunk along the hills,
as though they hastened to some place of secret meeting.
Daniel passed down among them, and was within a hundred
yards of the farm, when Prout, on a grey pony, met
him.
</p>

<p>
"You've seed Friend and told him about the peat?" he
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Ess; 'twill be ready&mdash;'tis ready now, for that matter."
</p>

<p>
"A curious human be Greg Friend," commented Mr. Prout.
"Peat!  Why, he's made of peat&mdash;body and bones&mdash;just
the same as me an' you be made of earth.  He thinks
peat, and dreams peat, and talks peat&mdash;the wonder is he
don't eat peat!"
</p>

<p>
John Prout lived alone in a cottage thirty yards from the
main building of Ruddyford.  It contained four rooms, of
which he only occupied two.  Now and again Tabitha
insisted upon tidying up for him, but he dreaded her visitations,
and avoided them as much as possible.
</p>

<p>
Brendon stopped at his door, and John spoke again before
he alighted.
</p>

<p>
"Not but what Friend isn't a very good sort of man.
The peat's a bee in his bonnet, yet never an honester or
straighter chap walked among us.  He looks to Amicombe
Hill to make everybody's fortune presently."
</p>

<p>
"He calls it the Promised Land," said Daniel.
</p>

<p>
"He do&mdash;poor fellow!  He's out there.  It don't promise
nothing and won't yield nothing.  They bogs have swallowed
a long sight more solid money than anybody will ever dig
up out of 'em again; and 'twould be well for Greg's peace
of mind if he could see it; but he won't.  He goes messing
about with his bottles and bellows, and gets gas and tar
out of the stuff, and makes such a fuss, as though he'd
found diamonds; but 'tis all one.  Peat's good, but coal's
better, and God A'mighty meant it to be.  You can't turn
peat into coal, or hurry up nature.  She won't be hurried,
and there's an end of it."
</p>

<p>
"He've got a fine darter, seemingly."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prout laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! you met her&mdash;eh?  Yes, she's a proper maiden&mdash;a
regular wonder in her way&mdash;so open, and clear-minded as
a bird.  Never yet heard a girl speak so frank&mdash;'tis like a
child more than what you'd expect from a grown-up woman.
But ban't she lovely in her Sunday frill-de-dills!  I was up
over last spring, and drinked a dish of tea with 'em.  Lucky
the chap as gets her&mdash;bachelor though I am, I say it."
</p>

<p>
"Be she tokened?"
</p>

<p>
"A good few's after her, I believe; but there's only one
in the running.  I mean Jarratt Weekes to Lydford&mdash;the
castle keeper there."
</p>

<p>
"I know the man&mdash;why, he's old!"
</p>

<p>
"Doan't you say that.  'Tis hard thing for my ears to
hear.  If he's old at forty, what be I at sixty-five?  I won't
let nobody say I'm old, Daniel!"
</p>

<p>
"Old for her, I mean.  There must be best part of
twenty year between 'em."
</p>

<p>
"It often works very well an' keeps down the family."
</p>

<p>
"Can't fancy her along with that man."
</p>

<p>
"She won't ax your leave, my son.  But her father's
rather of your mind, I fancy.  Gregory never did like Jarratt
Weekes&mdash;nor any of the Weekes breed, for that matter.
Jarratt was spoiled as a child.  He'm the only son of his
parents, and more hard than soft&mdash;just as you would expect
the child of Hepsy Weekes to be.  She's stamped herself
upon him."
</p>

<p>
"Us'll be late for dinner if us talk any more; though
what you tell me is very interesting," answered Brendon.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br><br>
THE KEEPER OF THE CASTLE
</h3>

<p>
The former glories of Lydford have long since vanished
away; yet once it was among the most ancient of Devon
boroughs, and stood only second to Exeter in credit and
renown.  Before the Norman Conquest Lydford flourished
as a fortified town; when, "for largeness in lands and
liberties" no western centre of civilization might compare
with it.  But hither came the bloody Danes by way of
Tavistock, to consume with fire and sword, and raze this
Saxon stronghold to the ground.  From these blows the
borough recovered, and upon the ruins of the settlement
arose a mediæval town wherein, for certain centuries, there
reigned a measure of prosperity.  The late Norman castle
belonged to the twelfth century.  It was a true "keep"
and a stout border fortress.  Within its walls were held the
Courts, beneath its floors were hidden the dungeon, of the
Stannaries.  From the Commonwealth until two hundred
years ago, the castle lay in ruins; then a partial restoration
overtook it; Manor and Borough Courts were held there;
prisoners again languished within its walls.  But when
Prince Town rose, at the heart of Dartmoor's central wastes,
all seats of local authority were moved thither; Lydford
Castle fell back into final neglect, and the story of many
centuries was ended.

<br>
LYDFORD CASTLE
</p>

<p>
To-day this survival of ancient pride and power lies
gaunt, ruined, hideous, and, in unvenerable age, still squats
and scowls four-square to all the winds that blow.  From
its ugly window-holes to its tattered crown there is no
beautiful thing about it, save the tapestry of nature that sucks
life from its bones and helps to hide them.  Grass and ferns,
hawkweed, sweet yarrow, toadflax, and fragrant wormwood
thrive within its rents and crevices; seedling ash and elder
find foothold in the deep embrasures; ivy mantles the
masonry and conceals its meanness.  The place sulks, like
an untamable and unlovely beast dying.  It reflects to the
imagination the dolours and agonies of forlorn
wretches&mdash;innocent and guilty&mdash;who have pined and perished within
its dungeons.  Now these subterranean dens, stripped to
the light, are crumbling between the thumb and forefinger
of Time; their gloomy corners glimmer green with moss
and tongues of fern and moisture oozing; briars drape the
walls from which hung staples; wood strawberries, like
rubies, glitter among the riven stones.  Windows and a
door still gape in the thickness of the walls; and above,
where once were floors, low entrances open upon air.  In
the midst extends a square of grass; aloft, a spectator may
climb to the decayed stump of the ruin, and survey
Lydford's present humility; her church, dwarfed largely by the
bulk of the castle; her single row of little dwellings; the
dimpled land of orchards and meadows round about her; and
the wide amphitheatre of Dartmoor towering semi-circular
to the East.
</p>

<p>
Fifty years ago, as now, the village straggled away from
the feet of the castle under roofs of grey thatch and
tar-pitched slate.  Many of the cottages had little gardens
before them, and one dwelling, larger than the rest, stood
with a bright, rosy-washed face, low windows and low brow
of grey thatch, behind luxuriance of autumn flowers.  To
the door of it there led a blue slate path, and on either side
smiled red phloxes, bell-flowers, tiger-lilies with scarlet,
black-spattered chalices, and pansies of many shades.  A
little golden yew, clipped into a pyramid, stood on one side
of the door; upon the other sat a man peeling potatoes.
</p>

<p>
Philip Weekes was short and square and round in the
back.  His black beard, cut close to the chin, began to
turn white; his hair was also grizzled.  His cheeks were
red and round; his large grey eyes had a wistful expression,
as of eyes that ached with hope of a sight long delayed.
His voice, but seldom heard, was mournful in its cadence.
Now Mr. Weekes dropped his last potato into a pail of
water; then he picked up the pail, and a second, that
contained the peelings.  With these he went to the rear of
his house.  It was necessary to go out through the front
gate, and as he did so a friend stopped him.
</p>

<p>
"Nice weather, schoolmaster," he said in his mild tones.
"Very seasonable indeed.  And I observe your son up
at the ruin with a party every time I pass.  He must be
doing well, Mr. Weekes."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing to complain about, I believe; but Jarratt&mdash;to
say it friendly&mdash;is terrible close.  I don't know what
he's worth, Mr. Churchward."
</p>

<p>
"I expect your good lady does, however."
</p>

<p>
The father nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Very likely.  I ban't in all their councils."
</p>

<p>
The schoolmaster&mdash;a tall, stout man, with a pedagogic
manner and some reputation for knowledge&mdash;made no
comment upon this speech, but discreetly pursued his way.
He stopped at the Castle Inn, however, for the half-pint
of ale he always allowed himself after morning school.
The little public-house stood almost under the castle walls;
and beyond it rose a bower of ancient trees, through which
appeared the crocketed turrets of St. Petrock's.  Adam
Churchward was a widower and enjoyed high esteem at
Lydford.  People thought more of him than the vicar,
because though of lesser learning, he displayed it to
better advantage and denied himself to none.  He was
self-conscious under his large and heavy manner, but he
concealed the fact, and nobody knew the uneasiness that often
sat behind his white shirt-front and black tie, when accident
threatened the foundations of his fame.
</p>

<p>
As he emptied potato peelings into a barrel, there came
to the master of this flowery garden a wild and untidy
brown maid, easily to be recognized as the runaway Susan.
</p>

<p>
"Pleace, Uncle Phil, aunt says if you've done them
'taters she'd like 'em to see the fire, if us be going to have
dinner come presently."
</p>

<p>
"They'm done," he said.  "I be bringing of 'em."
</p>

<p>
A voice like a guinea-hen's came through the open door.
</p>

<p>
"Now, master, if you've finished looking at the sky,
I'll thank you to fetch a dollop o' peat.  An' be them fowls
killed yet?  You know what Mrs. Swain said last Saturday?
Yours be the bestest fowls as ever come into Plymouth
Market, Hephzibah,' she said.  'I'd go miles for such
poultry; an' you sell 'em too cheap most times; but if
your husband would only kill 'em a thought sooner, to
improve their softness&mdash;&mdash;'  'He shall do it, ma'am,' I
said; but well I knowed all the time I might so soon speak
to a pig in his sty as you&mdash;such a lazy rogue you be."
</p>

<p>
"I'll kill 'em after dinner&mdash;plenty of time."
</p>

<p>
"'Plenty of time'!  Always your wicked, loafing way.
Put off&mdash;put off&mdash;where's that gal?  Go an' sweep the best
bedroom, Susan.  'Plenty of time.'  You'll come to eternity
presently&mdash;with nothing to show for it.  Then, when they
ax what you've been doing with your time, you'll cut a
pretty cheap figure, Philip Weekes."
</p>

<p>
Her husband exhibited a startling indifference to this
attack; but it was the indifference that an artilleryman
displays to the roar and thunder of ordnance.  His wife talked all
day long&mdash;often half the night also; and her language was
invariably hyperbolic and sensational.  Nobody ever took
her tragic diction seriously, least of all her husband.  His
position in the home circle was long since defined.  He did
a great deal of women's work, suffered immense indignities
with philosophic indifference, and brightened into some
semblance of content and satisfaction once a week.  This
was upon Saturday nights, when his partner invariably slept
at Plymouth.  Her husband and she were hucksters; but
since, among its other disabilities, Lydford was denied the
comfort of a market, they had to seek farther for customers,
and it was to Plymouth that they took their produce.
</p>

<p>
Every Friday Mr. Weekes harnessed his pony and drove
a little cart from Lydford into Bridgetstowe, through certain
hamlets.  He paid a succession of visits, and collected from
the folk good store of eggs, butter, rabbits, ducks, honey,
apples and other fruit, according to the season.  His own
contributions to the store were poultry and cream.  He had
one cow, and kept a strain of large Indian game fowls which
were noted amongst the customers of Mrs. Weekes.  On
Saturday the market woman was driven to Lydford Station
with her stores, and after a busy day in Plymouth, she slept
with a married niece there, and returned to her home again
on the following morning.
</p>

<p>
This programme had continued for nearly forty years.
On rare occasions Philip Weekes himself went to market;
but, as his wife declared, "master was not a good salesman,"
and she never let him take her place at the stall if
she could help it.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-034"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-034.jpg" alt="LYDFORD.">
<br>
LYDFORD.
</p>

<p>
Hephzibah was a little, lean woman, with white, wild
locks sticking out round her head, like a silver aureole that
had been drawn through a bramble-bush.  She had bright
pink cheeks, a long upper lip, a hard mouth with very few
teeth left therein, and eyes that feared nothing and dropped
before nothing.  She was proud of herself and her house.
She had a mania for sweeping her carpets; and if at any
moment Susan was discovered at rest, her aunt instantly
despatched her to the broom.  After a good market
Hephzibah was busier than ever, and drove her niece and her
husband hither and thither before her, like leaves in a gale
of wind; if the market had been bad, the strain became
terrific, and Susan generally found it necessary, to run away.
Mr. Weekes could not thus escape; but he bowed under the
tempest, anticipated his wife's commands to the best of
his power, and contrived to be much in the company of his
Indian game fowls.  After each week of tragical clacking
and frantic sweeping Saturday came, and the peace of the
grave descended upon Mr. Weekes.  During Saturday he
would not even suffer Susan to open her mouth.
</p>

<p>
"'Pon Saturdays give me silence," he said.  "The ear
wants rest, like any other member."
</p>

<p>
While his wife's shrill tongue echoed about her corner
of the market-place and lured customers from far, he sat
at home in a profound reverie and soaked in silence.  By
eventide he felt greatly refreshed, and generally spent an
hour or two at the Castle Inn&mdash;a practice forbidden to him
on other days.
</p>

<p>
"Go," said Mrs. Weekes; "go this instant moment,
afore dinner, an' kill the properest brace you can catch.
If you won't work, you shan't eat, and that's common-sense
and Bible both.  Mrs. Swain said&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Her husband nodded, felt that his penknife was in his
pocket, and went out.  The poultry-run stood close at hand
at the top of Philip's solitary field.  Sacks were nailed along
the bottom of the gate, to keep safe the chicks, and a large
fowl-house filled one corner.  As the master entered, a
hundred handsome birds, with shining plumage of cinnamon
and ebony, ran and swooped round him in hope.  But he
had brought death, not dinner.  A gallows stood in a corner,
and soon two fine fowls hung from it by their long yellow
legs and fulfilled destiny.  Then Mr. Weekes girt an apron
about him, took the corpses into a shed, spread a cloth for
the feathers, sat down upon a milking-stool and began to
pluck them.
</p>

<p>
Meantime the other occupant of his home had returned
to dinner.  Jarratt Weekes, the huckster's son, came back
from his morning's work at the castle and called to his
mother to hasten the meal.
</p>

<p>
"There's quite a lot of people about to-day," he said,
"and a party of a dozen be coming up at three o'clock to
look over the ruin."
</p>

<p>
"Then you must make hay while the sun shines,"
declared Mrs. Weekes.
</p>

<p>
Hephzibah's only child had now reached the age of
forty, and the understanding between them was very close
and intimate.  Reticent to all else, he found his mother so
much of his own way of thinking, that from her he had
no secrets.  She admired his thrift, and held his penuriousness
a virtue.  Despite her garrulity, Mrs. Weekes could
keep close counsel where it suited her to do so; and neither
her son's affairs nor her own ever made matter for speech.
They enjoyed an inner compact from which even the head
of the house was excluded.  Jarratt Weekes despised his
father, and failed to note the older man's virtues.  The
castle-keeper himself could boast a personable exterior; but
he was mean, and his countenance, though not unhandsome,
betrayed it.  He loved money for itself, and had saved ever
since he was a boy.  His clean-shorn, strongly featured
face was spoiled by the eyes.  They were bright and very
keen, but too close together.  He looked all his years by
reason of a system of netted lines that were stamped over
his forehead, upon his cheeks and round the corners of
his lips.  He lent money, ran sheep upon Dartmoor, and
was busy in many small ways that helped his pocket.  He
paid his mother five shillings a week for board and lodging;
and she tried almost every day of her life to make him give
seven-and-six, yet secretly admired him for refusing to do
so.  He was of medium height, and in figure not unlike his
father, but still straight in the back and of upright bearing.
</p>

<p>
Jarratt sat down at the kitchen table, while his mother
made ready a meal for him.  The room was empty, and
overhead sounded the regular stroke of Susan's broom.
</p>

<p>
"Glad you're alone," he said, "for I wanted to talk a
moment.  I saw Sarah Jane to Bridgetstowe yesterday.
She'd come down with a message from her father.  Sunday
week she's going to take her dinner with us.  Then I shall
ax her."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Weekes nodded, and for a moment her tongue was
silent.  She looked at her son, and a shadow of something
akin to emotion swept over her high-coloured cheeks and
bold eyes.
</p>

<p>
"What a change 'twill be!  I suppose you'll take the
house to the corner?  Mrs. Routleigh can't hold out over
Christmas."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I shall take it.  But there's Sarah Jane to be
managed first."
</p>

<p>
"Not much trouble there.  She ban't a fool.  She'll
jump at you."
</p>

<p>
"You're not often wrong; but I'm doubtful.  Sarah's
not like other girls.  She don't care for comfort and
luxury."
</p>

<p>
"Give her the chance!  She's young yet.  They all
like comfort, and they all want a husband.  Quite right
too."
</p>

<p>
"She can have her pick of twenty husbands&mdash;such a rare
piece as her."
</p>

<p>
"Them pretty ones all think that; an' they often come
to grief over it.  They put off choosing year after year till
suddenly they find 'emselves wrong side of thirty, and the
flat chits, that was childern yesterday, grown up into
wife-old maidens.  Then they run about after the men they used
to despise.  But the men be looking for something younger
by that time.  You men&mdash;the years betwixt thirty to forty
don't hit you; and what you lose in juice an' comeliness,
you make up at the bank.  But ban't so with us.  There's
no interest on good looks&mdash;all the other way.  These things
I've told Sarah Jane myself; so be sure she knows 'em.
You'm a thought old for her: that's my only fear."
</p>

<p>
"Would you go at it like a bull at a gate, or wind round
it?  She knows well enough what I feel.  Why, I gived
her a brooch that cost five shillings and sixpence come her
last birthday."
</p>

<p>
"Dash at her!  She's the sort that must be stormed.
Don't dwell over-much on the advantages, because she's
too young to prize 'em.  Catch fire an' blaze like a young
'un.  They like it best that way.  Don't take 'no' for an
answer.  'Twas a dash that caught me; though you'd never
think it to see your father now-a-days."
</p>

<p>
He listened respectfully.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not the dashing sort, however."
</p>

<p>
"No, you ban't.  Still, that's the best way with she.
Many a woman's been surprised into saying 'yes.'  Do
anything but write it.  Sarah Jane wouldn't stand writing.
For that matter, 'tis a question if she can read penmanship.
An ignorant girl along of her bringing up."
</p>

<p>
"Good at figures, however; for Gregory Friend told me
so."
</p>

<p>
"What does he know about figures?  Still, 'tis very
much in her favour if true."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Weekes now went to the window and looked out
of it.  Down the street stood an ivy-covered cottage where
two ways met.  Beside it men were working in the road.
</p>

<p>
"The water-leat will run through your back orchard,
won't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I'd counted upon that.  The new leat goes from
one side to t'other.  'Twill be a great source of strength
and improve the value of the property."
</p>

<p>
"The sooner you buy the better then&mdash;afore Widow
Routleigh understands&mdash;eh?"
</p>

<p>
He hesitated a moment, then confessed.
</p>

<p>
"I have bought," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Well done you!  Why didn't you tell me?"
</p>

<p>
"I was going to.  But keep silent as the pit about it.
Only me, an' her, and her lawyer knows.  As a matter
of fact, I bought before the leat got near the place.  I
knowed 'twas coming; they never thought of it."
</p>

<p>
"You'm a wonder!"
</p>

<p>
She looked at the house destined for her son and his bride.
</p>

<p>
"You won't be far off&mdash;that's to the good.  You an' me
must always be close cronies, Jar.  Who else have I got?"
</p>

<p>
"No fear of that."
</p>

<p>
She went to the oven, put a stew upon the table, and
lifted her voice to the accustomed penetrating note.
</p>

<p>
"Dinner!  Dinner!  Come, master!  Us can't bide
about all afternoon for you.  Susan, get down house, will
'e, an' let me see the dustpan.  I know what your sweeping
be like&mdash;only too well."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Weekes received a volume of reproaches as he entered
five minutes later, and took his place at the head of the
table.
</p>

<p>
"I've been plucking fowls, an' had to wash," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Then I hope to God you chose the right ones.  Mrs. Swain
<i>will</i> have 'em the same size to a hair.  If they come
to table a thought uneven, her pleasure's spoilt.  And the
best customer I've got in the Three Towns.  But what do
you care...?  Susan, you dirty imp, can't you...
Tchut!  If your parents don't turn in their graves, it ban't
no fault of yours...!"
</p>

<p>
So she played chorus to the banquet.  How Mrs. Weekes
ever found time to eat none knew.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
WATTERN OKE
</h3>

<p>
When Daniel Brendon stepped out of the world into
church, a change came upon his spirit, and he had the
power of absorbing himself in religious fervour.  He lived
under the permanent sense of a divine presence, and when
life prospered with him and nothing hurt or angered him,
the labourer's mind was cheered by the companionship of
his Maker.  Only if overtaken by a dark mood, or conscious
of wrong-doing, did he feel solitary.  The experience was
rare, yet he faced it without self-delusion, and assured
himself that when God forsook his heart, the fault was his
own.
</p>

<p>
In a temper amiable and at peace he kept the Sunday
appointment with Gregory Friend.  During morning worship
he had heard a sermon that comforted his disquiet, and
served for a time to mask from his sight the ambitions
proper to his nature.  He had been told to do with his might
the thing that his hand found to do; he had been warned
against casting his desires in too large a mould; he had
heard of the dignity of patience.
</p>

<p>
Brendon's mind was therefore contented, and as he strode
through the evening of the year's work and marked the
sun turn westward over a mighty pageant of autumn, he
felt resignation brooding within him.  Nature, for once,
chimed with the things of his soul and blazoned a
commentary upon the cherished dogmas of his faith.
</p>

<p>
He stood where the little Rattle leapt to Tavy, flung a
last loop of light, and, laughing to the end of her short life,
poured her crystal into a greater sister's bosom.  Sinuously,
by many falls, they glided together under the crags and
battlements of the Cleeve; and the September sun beat
straight into that nest of rivers, to touch each lesser rill
that threaded glittering downward and hung like a silver
rope over shelf of stone, or in some channel cut by ancient
floods.  Their ways were marked by verdure; by sphagnum,
in sheets of emerald or rose, orange or palest lemon; by
dark rushes, stiffly springing, and by the happiness of secret
flowers.  Heath and grey, granite shone together; a smooth,
green coomb stretched beside water's meet, but beyond
it all was confusion of steep hills and stony precipices.
Over their bosoms the breath of autumn hung in misty
fire, while strange, poised boulders crouched upon them
threateningly and sparkled in the sun.  Haze of blue
brake-fern shimmered here and burnt at points to sudden gold,
where death had already touched it.  Light streamed down,
mingling with the air, until all things were transfigured and
the darkest shadows abounded in warm tones.  The ling
still shone, and its familiar, fleeting mantle of pale amethyst
answered the brilliance of the sky with radiant flower-light
that refreshed the jewels of the late furze by splendour
of contrast.  The unclouded firmament lent its proper glory
to this vale.  Even under the sun's throne air was made
visible, and hung like a transparent curtain over the
world&mdash;a curtain less than cloud and more than clarity.  It
obscured nothing, yet informed the great hills and distant,
sunk horizon with its own azure magic; it transfused the
far-off undulations of the earth, and so wrought upon leagues
of sun-warmed ether that they washed away material details
and particulars.  There remained only huge generality of
light aloft, and delicate, vague delineation of opal and of
pearl in the valleys beneath.
</p>

<p>
The rivers, spattered with rocks and wholly unshadowed,
ran together in a skein of molten gold.  Behind the
murmuring hills they vanished westerly; and though these
waters gleamed with the highest light under the sky, yet
even in the dazzling force of sheer sunshine, flung direct
upon their liquid mirrors, were degrees of brilliance&mdash;from
the pure and steady sheen of pools, through splendour of
broken waters, up to blinding flashes of foam, where the
sun met a million simultaneous bubbles and stamped the
tiny, blazing image of himself upon each.
</p>

<p>
Sunshine indeed poured out upon all created things.  It
lighted the majesty of the hills and flamed above each
granite tower and heather ridge; it brightened the coats of
the wandering herds and shone upon little rough calves and
foals that crept beside their mothers; it touched the solitary
heron's pinion, as he flapped heavily to his haunt; and
forgot not the wonder of Vanessa's wings, nor the snake
on the stone, nor the lizard in the herbage.  Each diurnal
life was glorified by the splendour of day; and when there
fell presently a cloud-shadow, like a bridge across the Cleeve,
it heightened the surrounding brilliance and, passing, made
the light more admirable.  Upward, like the music from a
golden shell, came Tavy's immemorial song; and it echoed
most musical on the ear of him who, crowning this vision
with conscious intelligence, could dimly apprehend some
part of what he saw.
</p>

<p>
Daniel seated himself on rocks overlooking the Cleeve.
His massive body felt the sun's heat strike through it;
and now he stared unblinking upward, and now scanned
the glen upon his right.  That way, round, featureless hills
climbed one behind the other, until they rose to a distant
gap upon the northern horizon where stood Dunnagoat cot
against the sky.  Low tors broke out of the hills about it,
and upon their summits, like graven images, the cattle stood
in motionless groups, according to their wont on days of
great heat.
</p>

<p>
Brendon rose presently, stretched himself, and, seen far
off, appeared to be saluting the sun.  Then he turned to
the hills and passed a little way along them.  His eye had
marked two specks, a mile distant, and as they approached
they grew into a man and woman.
</p>

DUNNAGOAT COT.
</p>

<p>
Gregory Friend, with his daughter, met Daniel beside a
green barrow.  He shook hands and remarked on the
splendour of the hour.  The peat-man had put off his
enthusiasm with his working clothes.  He wore black and
appeared somewhat bored and listless, for the week-days only
found him worshipping.
</p>

<p>
"He hates Sabbaths," explained Sarah.  "To keep off
his business be a great trouble to him; but he says as we
must mark the day outwardly as well as inwardly.  So he
dons his black, an' twiddles his thumbs, an' looks up the
valley to the works, but holds away from 'em."
</p>

<p>
She wore a crude blue dress that chimed with nothing
in nature and fitted ill.  Brendon, however, admired it
exceedingly.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis very nice 'pon top of Wattern Oke, if you care to
come so far," he said.
</p>

<p>
They returned to the place where Daniel had sat.
</p>

<p>
"I'll spread my coat for 'e, so as you shan't soil thicky
lovely gown," he suggested to Sarah Jane.
</p>

<p>
"No call to do that, thank you.  I'll sit 'pon this stone.
I'm glad you like the dress.  I put it on for you to see.
My word, 'tis summer come back again to-day!"
</p>

<p>
The labourer was fluttered, but could think of nothing
to say.  Both men smoked their pipes, and Friend began
to thrust his stick into the earth.  They spoke of general
subjects, then Daniel remembered a remark that the other
had made upon their first meeting.  He had no desire to
hear more concerning peat; but his heart told him that the
theme must at least give one of the party pleasure, and
therefore he led to it.  Moreover, he felt a strong desire
to please Gregory, yet scarcely knew his reason.
</p>

<p>
"You was going to give me a little of your large
knowledge 'bout Amicombe Hill, master," he said, after an
interval of silence.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Friend's somewhat lethargic attitude instantly
changed.  He sat up briskly and his eyes brightened.
</p>

<p>
"So I was then; and so I will.  To think that within
eye-shot at this moment there's more'n enough fuel to fill
every hearth in England!  There's a masterpiece of a
thought&mdash;eh?  If people only realized that....  And
Amicombe Hill peat be the very cream and marrow of it
all&mdash;the fatness of the land's up there&mdash;better than granite,
or tin, or anything a man may delve in all Dartymoor."
</p>

<p>
"Not a doubt of it&mdash;not a doubt," said the listener; but
Sarah Jane shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you encourage him, Mr. Brendon, or I'll not
have you up the hill no more.  Ban't six days a week
enough for one subject?  Can't us tell about something
different Sundays?"
</p>

<p>
"Plenty of time," answered her father.  "Peat's a
high matter enough in my opinion.  If us knowed all there
is to know about it, us should see nearer into the ways of
God in the earth, I'm sure.  There's things concerning
Amicombe peat no man has yet found out, and perhaps no
man ever will."
</p>

<p>
"On week-days he lives up to his eyes in the peat, an'
'pon Sundays he preaches it," said Sarah.  "That is
when any man's silly enough to let him," she added
pointedly.
</p>

<p>
Her father began to show a little annoyance at these
interruptions.
</p>

<p>
"You'd best to go and walk about, an' leave me an'
Brendon to talk," he said.
</p>

<p>
"So I will, then, my dear," she answered, laughing;
"an' when you've done, one of you can stand up on a rock
an' wave his handkercher; then I'll come back."
</p>

<p>
To Daniel's dismay, she rose and strolled off.  Friend
chattered eagerly; Sarah Jane's blue shape dwindled, and
was presently lost to sight.
</p>

<p>
For half-an-hour the elder kept up a ceaseless discourse;
but, since Daniel did nothing more than listen, and scarcely
asked a question to help the matter, Gregory Friend began
to tire.  He stopped, then proceeded.  He stopped again,
yawned, and relighted his pipe.
</p>

<p>
"That's just the beginning about peat," he said.  "But
don't think you know nothing yet.  My darter knows more
than that&mdash;ignorant though she is."
</p>

<p>
"Not ignorant, I'm sure.  But&mdash;well, shall I tell her
that, just for the present, we've done wi' peat, or would
you rather&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
Gregory felt that Brendon had fairly earned a respite and
reward.  Moreover, the sunshine was making him sleepy.
</p>

<p>
"Go an' look after her," he said.  "An' come back to
me presently.  I'll have forty winks.  Nought on earth
makes me so dog-tired as laziness."
</p>

<p>
Daniel was gone in a moment, yet, as he strode whence
the girl had disappeared, he found time to ask himself what
this must mean.  He had never looked round after a woman
in his life.  Women about a place made him uneasy, and
acted as a restraint on comfort.  He knew nothing whatever
concerning them, and was quite content to believe the
opinions of John Prout: that, upon the whole, a man
might be better single.  Yet this woman had interested him
from the first moment that he saw her; he had thought of
her not seldom since; he had anticipated another meeting
with interest that was pleasure.
</p>

<p>
He crossed Wattern Oke, then looked down where Tavy
winds beneath the stony side of Fur Tor.  A bright blue
spot appeared motionless at the brink of the river.  Daniel,
feeling surprise to think that she had wandered so far,
hastened forward and, in a quarter of an hour, stood beside
her.  She smiled at him.
</p>

<p>
"I knowed you'd come for me," she said.  "There was
that in your face made me feel it.  You was sorry when I
went off?"
</p>

<p>
"So I was then."
</p>

<p>
"I rather wanted to see if you would be.  It shows
friendship.  I like men to be friends with me.  I often wish
I'd been born a man myself&mdash;'stead of a woman.  I'm
such a big maiden, an' awful strong&mdash;not but what I look
more than a fly beside you.  You could pick me up in they
gert arms, I reckon?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose I could for that matter.  I carried a pig
yesterday&mdash;lifted un clean up an' got un on my back; but
it took two other chaps to move it.  'Twas Agg and Tapson.
'Here, let me get to his carcase,' I said; an' I lifted it
clear into the butcher's cart, while they two was wiping
their foreheads!"
</p>

<p>
She nodded with evident approval.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly his slow mind worked backwards.
</p>

<p>
"All the same," he said, "I didn't ought to have
mentioned your name in the same breath with a pig.  'Twas
a hole in my manners, and I hope you'll overlook it."
</p>

<p>
Sarah Jane laughed.
</p>

<p>
"What a man!  Where was you brought up to?  Ban't
many so civil in these parts."
</p>

<p>
"I was teached to be civil by my mother.  But I know
nought beyond my business&mdash;not like Mister Woodrow.
He has grammer-school larning, an' London larning, and
reads books that I can't understand a word about."
</p>

<p>
She told him of her own childhood, of her mother, of her
few friends.
</p>

<p>
"Girls don't seem to like me," she said.  "I hardly know
above half-a-dozen of 'em.  There's Minnie Taverner to
Lydford, and Mary Churchward&mdash;nobody much else.  Mary's
brother's nearly as big as you be.  But t'others I used to
know, when I went to school, are all married or gone to
service now."
</p>

<p>
"Very interesting," said Daniel.  "I never had but one
sister.  She's down to Plymouth&mdash;a greengrocer's wife
there."
</p>

<p>
They talked freely together, and presently rose and set
out to rejoin Mr. Friend.  Under their feet Daniel suddenly
saw a piece of white ling, and stopped and picked it.
</p>

<p>
"May I make bold to ax you to take it?" he said.
"'Tis an old saying that it brings fortune."
</p>

<p>
"Then I won't accept of it," she said.  "Thank you all
the same; but fortune's in the wind for me already; an'
I don't want it very much.  I'm happy enough where I be
along with my father."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me about the fortune," he said, flinging the heath
away.
</p>

<p>
Thereupon she reminded him that, despite her masculine
aspirations and amazing frankness, she was a woman after
all.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes fell, then rose to his face again.  A glorious,
gentle, gentian blue they were.
</p>

<p>
"You want to know such a lot, Mr. Brendon," she said.
</p>

<p>
He was crushed instantly, and poured forth a string of
apologies.
</p>

<p>
"You all do it," she answered.  "I don't know what
there is about me; but you chaps get so friendly&mdash;I feel as
if I'd got about fifty brothers among you.  But there's
things you can't tell even brothers, you know."
</p>

<p>
"I'm terrible sorry.  Just like my impudence to go
pushing forward so.  I deserve a clip on the side o' the
head&mdash;same as my mother used to box my ears when I
was a little one, an' hungry to ax too many questions."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Friend was awake and ready to walk homeward.
Daniel accepted an invitation to tea, and accompanied
them.
</p>

<p>
They ascended slowly by the steep channels of the
Rattle-brook, and presently Gregory rested awhile.
</p>

<p>
"I can't travel same as once I could," he explained.
Then he moralized.
</p>

<p>
"The world's an up an' down sort of place, like this here
fen," he said.  "Some holds the good and evil be balanced
to a hair, so that every man have his proper share of each;
but for my part I can't think it."
</p>

<p>
"The balance be struck hereafter.  That trust a man
must cling to&mdash;or else he'll get no happiness out of living,"
answered Daniel; and the other nodded.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis the only thought as can breed content in the mind;
yet for the thousands that profess to believe it, you'll not
find tens who really do so."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure I do," asserted Brendon.
</p>

<p>
"At your time of life 'tis easy enough.  But wait till
you'm threescore and over.  Then the spirit gets impatient,
and it takes a very large pattern of faith to set such store
on the next world that failure in this one don't sting.  If
I am took from yonder peat works afore their fame be
established to the nation, I shall go reluctant, and I own it.
There'll be nought so interesting in Heaven&mdash;from my point
of view&mdash;as Amicombe Hill."
</p>

<p>
"You'll have something better to think of and better to
do, master."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe I shall; but my mind will turn that way, and I
shall think it terrible hard if all knowledge touching the
future of the place be withholden from me."
</p>

<p>
"We shall know so much of things down here as be
good for our peace of mind, I reckon?" ventured Daniel.
</p>

<p>
"'Twould be wisht to have all blank," declared Sarah
Jane.  "Take the mothers an' wives.  What's the joy of
heaven to them if they don't know things is going well
with their children an' husbands?"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis almost too high a subject for common people,
though I could wish for light upon it myself," said her
father.
</p>

<p>
"Of course they know!" cried the woman.  "Don't
you believe as mother holds us in her thoughts and watches
our goings?  Such a worrying spirit as hers!  Heaven
wouldn't be no better than a foreign country, where she
couldn't get letters, if you an' me was hidden from
her."
</p>

<p>
Daniel felt uneasy.
</p>

<p>
"Knowing what she knows now, she would be content
to leave it with God," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Not her," answered Sarah Jane.  "A very suspicious
nature, where those she loved was concerned."
</p>

<p>
"True.  My wife could believe nought but her own eyes.
She was built so.  That's why she never would share my
great opinions of Amicombe Hill.  A very damping woman
to a hopeful heart.  A great trust in arithmetic she had;
but for my part nought chills me like black figures on white
paper.  You can't draw much comfort from 'em most
times."
</p>

<p>
"I'm like her," said Sarah Jane.  "All for saying what
I think.  Father here's a dreamer."
</p>

<p>
"Hope's very good to work on, however; I hold with
Mr. Friend there."
</p>

<p>
"Not so good as wages," said Sarah Jane.
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes in my uplifted moments I've wondered
whether truth's made known to my wife now, and whether,
looking down 'pon Dartymoor, she knows that I was right
touching Amicombe Hill, and she was wrong," mused
Gregory.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps she knows she was right and you are wrong,
my old dear," suggested Sarah Jane.
</p>

<p>
But her father shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I ban't feared of that," he answered.
</p>

<p>
After a cup of tea, Daniel Brendon made a faltering
proposal, and met with a startling reply.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder now, if you and Miss here would take a walk
along o' me next Sunday?" he asked.  "I'll meet 'e where
you please.  And I'm sure I should be terrible proud if
you could lend me your company."
</p>

<p>
"I can't&mdash;not next Sunday," declared the girl.  "'Tis
like this: I'm going to Lydford to spend the day along with
the Weekes family.  And Jarratt Weekes be going to ax
me to marry him."
</p>

<p>
Dan's eyes grew round.
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord!" he said, with surprise and reverence
mingled.
</p>

<p>
"That's what the man's going to do, if I know him.
'Tis all planned out in his mind.  I could most tell the
words he'm going to say it in&mdash;knowing him so well as I
do."
</p>

<p>
A natural question leapt to Brendon's lips, but he
restrained it.  He wanted to ask, "And shall you take him?"
but resisted the burning temptation.  This news, however,
was a source of very active disquiet.  He drank his tea, and
was glad when Gregory Friend broke the silence.
</p>

<p>
"And you'll do well to think twice afore you say 'yes,'
Sarah Jane.  A successful and a church-going man.  A
good son, I believe, and honest&mdash;as honesty goes in towns.
But&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I'd never get a husband if I waited for you to find
one, faither."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps not.  Good husbands are just as rare as good
wives."
</p>

<p>
"Then&mdash;then perhaps Sunday after&mdash;&mdash;?" persisted
Brendon, whose mind had not wandered far from the mam
proposition.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps," answered Sarah Jane. "You'm burning to
hear tell what I shall say to the castle-keeper&mdash;ban't 'e
now?"
</p>

<p>
"Who wouldn't be&mdash;such a fateful thing!  But I know
my manners better than to ax, I hope."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what I'm going to say," declared she.
"D'you know Jarratt Weekes?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't."
</p>

<p>
"Does anybody to Ruddyford?"
</p>

<p>
"Most of 'em know him."
</p>

<p>
"What do they say about him?"
</p>

<p>
Brendon hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"Can't answer that: wouldn't be fair to the man."
</p>

<p>
"You have answered it!" she said, and laughed.
</p>

<p>
A moment later he took his leave and strode slowly over
the hills.  So absorbed was he, that he did not watch his
way, and presently tripped and fell.  The accident cleared
his mind.
</p>

<p>
"This be a new thing in me," he thought.  "That
blessed, lovely she's bewitched me, if I know myself!
She'll take the man, no doubt.  And yet&mdash;why?  Such a
face as that might look as high as a farmer at the lowest."

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br><br>
PLAIN SPEAKING
</h3>

<p>
A peace of unusual duration brooded over the dwelling of
Philip Weekes; for his wife had gone to market on Saturday
morning, but instead of returning home, according to
her custom, in time for Sunday dinner at Lydford, she
continued at Plymouth until the evening.
</p>

<p>
He basked in silence like a cat in the sun; but a few
friends were coming to drink tea, and Susan already made
preparations for the event.
</p>

<p>
Elsewhere, Sarah Jane, who was spending the day at
Lydford, sat in a secret place with Jarratt Weekes and
heard the things that she expected to hear.
</p>

<p>
The old castle was not opened to visitors on Sunday, but
Jarratt kept the keys, and, after dinner, took Sarah to his
fortress and offered her marriage within its mediæval walls.
She wore her blue dress; he held himself a grade above
those men who habitually don black upon the seventh day,
and was attired in a mustard-coloured tweed suit.
</p>

<p>
"We'll come aloft," he said.  "There's a window opens
to the west, and I've put a seat there for visitors to sit in
and look around.  'Tis out of sight of the street, and will
shield you from the east wind that's blowing."
</p>

<p>
He offered to assist her up the wooden stairway, but she
made as though she did not see and followed him easily.
</p>

<p>
Presently they sat together, and he sighed and twirled
his gold watch-chain in a fashion to catch her eye.  She
noted his well-shaped and strong hand.
</p>

<p>
"I dare say you think I'm a happy man, Sarah Jane,"
he began abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think anything about you," she answered;
"but all the same, you ought to be.  Why not?  Everything
goes well with you, don't it?  Mr. Huggins met me in the
village as I came along.  He says that you've bought
Widow Routleigh's beautiful house at the corner, and only
wait for her to die to go into it.  And the new leat will
run right through the orchard."
</p>

<p>
"So it will.  But don't think that was a chance.  I
worked it all out and knew the water must come that way.
I'd bought the ground, at my own price, before the old
woman even guessed the water was coming.  I say this to
show you how far I look ahead."
</p>

<p>
"Of course you do&mdash;like Mrs. Weekes.  You've got her
great cleverness, no doubt."
</p>

<p>
"That's true, and I could give you many instances if
you wanted them.  But, all the same, there's much worth
having that money won't buy.  Ban't the root of all good,
as some think, any more than 'tis the root of all evil, as
other fools pretend&mdash;chiefly them as lack it.  Money's all
right, but not all-powerful.  You, for instance&mdash;I know you
well enough to know that money don't count for everything
with you."
</p>

<p>
Sarah Jane plucked a spray of sweet wormwood that grew
out of the wall within reach of her hand.  She bruised it
and passed its pale gold and silver thoughtfully under her nose.
</p>

<p>
"I'd dearly like to have money," she said.
</p>

<p>
"You would?"
</p>

<p>
"Dearly.  I'd sooner have a hoss of my own to ride
than most anything I can think of."
</p>

<p>
"A very fine idea, no doubt.  And very fine you'd look
upon one."
</p>

<p>
She smelt the wormwood, then flung it through the
window and turned to him.
</p>

<p>
"But I wouldn't sell myself for that.  I've never thought
out the subject of money, and maybe never shall.  Faither's
always on about it; but 'tis only a sort of shadowy fancy
in his mind, like the next world, or China, or any other
place beyond his knowledge.  Money's just a big idea to
him and me.  But I doubt if we had it, whether we should
know how ever to manage it."
</p>

<p>
"Your father's no better than a wild man," said Jarratt
impatiently.  "So full of foggy hopes and opinions&mdash;nought
practical about any of 'em.  Now I'm nothing if not practical;
and more are you.  'Tis that I've felt about you ever
since you was wife-old.  But what d'you think of me?
People have an idea nobody could make much cash in a
place the size of Lydford.  Let 'em think so.  But I tell
you, Sarah Jane, that 'tis often the smallest stream holds
the biggest trout.  And I tell you another thing: I love
you with all my heart and soul.  There's nobody like you
in the world.  You're a rare woman, an' pretty as a picture
to begin with; but that ban't all.  You've got what's more
than good looks, and wears better, and helps a busy man on
his way.  You'd not hinder a husband, but back him up
with all your strength.  Never was a body with less
nonsense about her.  In fact, I've been almost frightened
sometimes, to think how awful little nonsense there is about
your nature&mdash;for so young a woman.  It comes of living
up-along wi' nought but natural things for company.  There's
no lightness nor laughter up there."
</p>

<p>
He stopped for breath; but she did not speak.  Then he
proceeded.
</p>

<p>
"Not that I blame you for being so plain-spoken.  'Tis
often the best way of all, an' saves a deal of precious time.
And time's money.  You only want a little more experience
of the ways of people, to shine like a star among common
women, who sail with the wind and always say what they
think you'll best like to hear.  But that's nought.  The
thing I want to say is that I love you, Sarah Jane, and
there's nothing in life I'd like better than to make a beautiful
home for you, with every comfort that my purse can afford
in it.  And a horse you certainly shall have; an' I'll teach
you how to ride him.  You're a thought too large for a
pony, but a good upstanding cob&mdash;and a pleasant sight
'twould be."
</p>

<p>
"Nobody could say fairer, I'm sure."
</p>

<p>
"Then will you have me?  I'm not good enough, or
anywheres near it.  Still, as men go, in these parts, you
might do worse&mdash;eh?"
</p>

<p>
"A lot worse.  What does your mother think about it?"
</p>

<p>
"She would sooner I married you than anybody&mdash;'if
I must marry at all.'  That was her view."
</p>

<p>
"Why marry at all, Jarratt Weekes?  Ban't you very
comfortable as you are?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a very loverly question," he said, somewhat
ruefully.  "I'm afraid you don't care much about me, Sarah
Jane."
</p>

<p>
"I don't like your eyes," she answered.  "I like the
rest of you very well.  And, after all's said, you can't help
'em."
</p>

<p>
"There 'tis!" he exclaimed, half in admiration, half
in annoyance.  "What girl on God's earth but you would
say a thing like that to a man that's offering marriage to
her?  To quarrel with my eyes be a foolish trick all the
same.  You might so well blame my hair, or my ears, or
my hands."
</p>

<p>
"Your hand is a fine, strong-shaped sort of hand."
</p>

<p>
"Take it then," he cried, "and keep it; an' give me
yours.  Let me run my life for you evermore; and for
your good and for your betterment.  I'm tired of running
it for myself.  I never knew how empty a man's life can
be&mdash;not till I met you; and there's the cottage, crawled over
with honeysuckle, and the swallows' nests under the eaves,
and the lovely orchard and all!  All waiting your good
pleasure, Sarah Jane, the moment that old woman
drops."
</p>

<p>
"I don't reckon I could marry you&mdash;such a lot goes to it.
Still, I'll be fair to you and take a bit of time to think it
over."
</p>

<p>
"You've got two strings to your bow, of course&mdash;like all
you pretty women?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I haven't.  Yet&mdash;well, there's a man I've seen a
few times lately.  And I do take to him something wonderful.
There's that about him I've never felt in no other man.
Only, so far as I know, he don't care a button for me.
He may be tokened, come to think of it.  I never heard
him say he wasn't.  I never thought of that!"
</p>

<p>
She sat quite absorbed by this sudden possibility, while
Jarratt Weekes stared angrily at her.
</p>

<p>
"You'll puzzle me to my dying day," he growled.  "If
any other female could talk such things, we'd say it was
terrible unmaidenly in her; but you&mdash;naked truth's indecent
in most mouths&mdash;it seems natural to yours.  Not that
I like you the better for it."
</p>

<p>
"He's a huge man, and works at Ruddyford.  He's been
drawing peat these last few days, and I've had speech with
him, an' gived him cider thrice.  To see him drink!"
</p>

<p>
"Damn him and his cider!" said Weekes, irritably.
"A common labourer!  You really ought to pride yourself
a thought higher, Sarah Jane.  What would your poor
mother have said?"
</p>

<p>
"She done exactly the same herself.  And a prettier
woman far than me when she was young.  For faither's
often told me so.  He's raised himself since he was married.
So might this chap.  All the same, I don't know whether
he gives me a thought when I'm out of his sight."
</p>

<p>
"I think of nought but you&mdash;all day long."
</p>

<p>
"And widows' houses, and a few other things!  Of
course you do.  You haven't got up in the world by wasting
your time."
</p>

<p>
"Say 'yes,' and be done with it, Sarah."
</p>

<p>
"I'll leave it for a round month, then I'll tell you."
</p>

<p>
"You'll leave it&mdash;just to see what this hulking lout on
the Moor may do."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  But he's not a lout.  I'm certainly not going to
take you till I know if he cares for me.  If he does, I'll
have him, for he's made me feel very queer&mdash;so queer that
it can't be anything but love.  And if he don't ax inside
six weeks, I'll take you."
</p>

<p>
"You're the sort to go and tell him to ask you," he
said, bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"No, no!  I won't do that.  I'm a very modest woman
really, though you don't seem to think so.  I'll not run
after him."
</p>

<p>
"You're mad to dream of such a thing."
</p>

<p>
"Very likely; but there 'tis.  Now us had better go
back-along.  I promised Mr. Weekes to pour out tea for
him this evening afore I went home."
</p>

<p>
"I'll walk back with you."
</p>

<p>
"No need.  Father's going to meet me on the old
tram-line.  He's down to Lake to-day."
</p>

<p>
They returned to the cottage of Philip Weekes, and
found the company assembled.
</p>

<p>
There were present a very ancient, wrinkled man with a
thin, white beard, called Valentine Huggins.  As happens
sometimes, he had out-lived his Christian name, and an
appellation, proper to youth, seemed so ridiculous applied to
a veteran of fourscore that nobody ever called him by it but
one or two of his own generation, who did not mark the
humour.  Mr. Huggins was the oldest inhabitant of Lydford,
and could count numerous grandchildren, though his own
sons and daughters were nearly all dead.  Adam Churchward,
the schoolmaster, and his daughter Mary completed the
gathering.  He was large, hairless, ponderous, and
flatulent; she nearly approached beauty, but her mouth was
thin, and her voice served to diminish the pleasure given
by her bright, dark face.  The tone of it sounded harsh
and rough, and when she spoke two little deep lines at their
corners increased the asperity of her lips.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose we may say, in the words of the harvest
hymn, that 'all is safely gathered in,'" remarked
Mr. Churchward, as he drank his tea.  "A good harvest, the
work-folk tell me&mdash;or, rather, their children."  He lifted
his protuberant, short-sighted and rather silly eyes upward,
to the conventional angle of piety.
</p>

<p>
"A very good harvest, I believe," admitted Philip, "and
good all round&mdash;so the missis brought word from market
last week."
</p>

<p>
"I trust the operations of sale and barter have been
all that you could wish," added Mr. Churchward.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing to grumble at&mdash;very good markets," declared
Philip, "though my partner never will admit it.  Still, figures
speak, and though she may pretend to lose her temper,
I always know.  Her pretences ban't like the real thing."
</p>

<p>
"No pretence about it when Aunt Hepsy's in a
right-down tantara of a rage," said Susan.
</p>

<p>
"An unusual name&mdash;a Scriptural name," remarked the
schoolmaster.  "Has the significance of the name of
'Hephzibah' ever struck your mind, neighbour?  It means,
'my delight is in her.'"
</p>

<p>
"So I've been told," answered the husband, drily.  Indeed,
his tone silenced the other, and, perceiving that he
had apparently struck a wrong note of suggestiveness, Philip
made haste to speak again.
</p>

<p>
"Nobody ever had a more suitable name, I'm sure.  This
house wouldn't be this house without her."
</p>

<p>
Jarratt Weekes and Sarah Jane now returned, and the
subject was dropped by implicit understanding.
</p>

<p>
"I hope your great son, William, be well," said Sarah
to the schoolmaster.
</p>

<p>
"Very well indeed, I thank you," he answered.  "I
could wish he had a little of his parent's zeal for toil, but
he lacks it."
</p>

<p>
"Why for did he give up his shop work?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"To be honest, it was rather undignified.  For my son
to fill that position was not quite respectful to me.  He
insisted upon it, but after a time, as I expected, found the
duties irksome.  I was not sorry when he changed his
mind and returned to his painting."
</p>

<p>
"All the same, he's eating his head off now," said Mary
Churchward.
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't say that," declared William's father.
"He helps me with the elder scholars.  I have little doubt
that some outlet for his artistic energies may soon be
forthcoming.  He has even an idea of going abroad."
</p>

<p>
"Do they still call him the 'Infant'?" asked Mr. Weekes.
</p>

<p>
"I believe so.  How time flies with those who work as
we do!  <i>Tempus fugit</i>, I'm sure.  It seems only yesterday
that he was really an infant.  In these arms the
physician placed him some hours after his birth, with the
remark that never had he introduced a fatter boy into the
world."
</p>

<p>
"So I've heard you say," answered the huckster.  "Give
Mary another cup of tea, please, Sarah Jane."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," continued Mr. Churchward.  "At first I had
reason to believe that William would develop very unusual
intellects.  His childhood was rich in evidences of a
precocious mind.  But it seemed, in the race between brain
and body, that after a struggle the physical being out-distanced
the mental spirit.  If I am becoming too subtle, stop
me.  But you may have observed that men above six feet
high are seldom brilliantly intelligent."
</p>

<p>
"I know a chap who is, however," said Sarah Jane.
"A young man bigger than your son, Mr. Churchward, but
a very great thinker in his way&mdash;so my father says."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Churchward raised his eyebrows incredulously, and
at the same moment bowed.
</p>

<p>
"Bill's sharp enough, and father knows it," said Mary
Churchward.  "He's horrid lazy; that's all that's the
matter with him.  If he had to work, 'twould be a very good
thing for him."
</p>

<p>
"The questions that child used to ask me!" continued
Adam.  "Why, I believe it is allowed that I can reply to
most people&mdash;am I right, Huggins?"
</p>

<p>
"Never yet knowed you to be floored," replied Mr. Huggins,
in an aged treble.  "There's the guts of a whole
libr'y of books packed behind your gert yellow forehead,
schoolmaster."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Huggins," said Mr. Churchward, with
dignity.  "Thank you.  Truth has always been your
guiding star since I have known you, and though your words
are homely, they come from the heart.  Pass me the sally-lunns,
Susan, and I'll tell you a good thing Will said when
he was no more than seven years old."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Churchward selected a cake, nibbled it, then waved it.
</p>

<p>
"Stop me if I have narrated this narrative before.  I was
giving the child a lesson in divinity.  Indeed, at one time
I had thoughts of the calling for him, but his mind took
another turn."
</p>

<p>
"He don't believe in nothing now&mdash;nothing at all," said
Mary, "except himself."
</p>

<p>
"You wrong him there.  He is a Christian at heart, if
I am any student of character.  But as a child, he indulged
in curious doubts.  'God made all things, I suppose, father?'
he asked me on the occasion I speak of.  'Yes, my little
man, He did indeed,' I answered.  'He made hell then?'
he asked.  'Surely,' I admitted.  'Was it for Mr. Satan
and his friends, so that they would all be comfy together?'
he asked.  'No doubt that they should be together; but
far from "comfy,"' I replied; 'and take good care, my
child, that it shall never be said of you that you are one of
those friends.'  Now is not that a remarkable instance of
juvenile penetration?"
</p>

<p>
"An' very good answers you made the nipper, I'm sure,"
said Mr. Weekes.
</p>

<p>
Here Jarratt changed the subject abruptly, and conversation
ranged over matters more generally interesting than
the schoolmaster's son.
</p>

<p>
"The water will be into Lydford come June next or a
little later, they tell me," said the keeper of the castle.
"I was showing the head engineer over the ruin last week&mdash;for
all the times he'd been here he'd never seen it&mdash;and
there's no doubt at all that the work will be done by next
spring."
</p>

<p>
"Then I must begin to think of our preparations,"
answered Adam.  "You may be aware that I am responsible
for the idea that something of an exceptional nature shall
be carried out to mark the arrival of the water.  I mentioned
it to the vicar two or three months ago, and he&mdash;well, if I
may say so, he showed a coldness."
</p>

<p>
"Always is cold unless he thinks of a thing himself,"
said Jarratt.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid you have hit off his character in a nutshell.
However, I am not to be shaken where I think the good of
Lydford is concerned.  'It's a year too soon to begin thinking
of it,' said the vicar to me; but I explained that these
things must be taken in time and carefully thought out.
'Do it yourself then, since you're so set upon it,' he said.
'Then you'll have no objection to my proceeding in the
matter, your reverence?' I asked, 'for I should like
everything <i>ex cathedrâ</i> and in order.'  'Oh, do what you like,
only don't let it be anything ridiculous,' he answered, in
his unkind, off-hand style.  'I'm not the man to bring
ridicule on Lydford or myself, I believe,' I replied, in my
haughty way."
</p>

<p>
"Had him there," chuckled Mr. Huggins.
</p>

<p>
"And with that I just bowed myself out."
</p>

<p>
"Us'll do it without troubling him, then," declared
Philip Weekes.  "The matter's very safe in your hands,
neighbour."
</p>

<p>
"I think it is.  Without self-praise&mdash;a thing I have
never been accused of&mdash;I think it is.  My own idea is
matured, but I am quite prepared to hear that a better one
is forthcoming."
</p>

<p>
"You should call a meeting and have a committee,"
suggested Jarratt.
</p>

<p>
"My idea was to have the committee without the meeting.
For instance&mdash;we here assembled&mdash;why can't we elect a
committee?"
</p>

<p>
"'Twill be too hole-and-corner," said Jarratt.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all, not at all.  This is neither a hole nor yet a
corner, but the house of one of the burgesses of Lydford.
We represent various interests.  I stand <i>in propriâ personâ</i>
for advancement and intellectual attainments, and the arts
and sciences, and such-like; Jarratt Weekes is for business
and mercantile pursuits and commerce; Mr. Huggins&mdash;well,
he's the oldest inhabitant.  'Twould be a very right
and proper thing to have him on the committee."
</p>

<p>
"Should like nothing better, souls," declared
Mr. Huggins.  "Talk I won't, but there must be some to
listen."
</p>

<p>
"We ought to have a few more&mdash;seven or eight in all,"
said the younger Weekes.  "Then we'll get through a
scheme of some sort and hear what you've got to say,
schoolmaster."
</p>

<p>
"The vicar will be very like to put his spoke in it if
your ideas don't meet his views," suggested Philip, and
Mr. Churchward's large pendulous cheeks flushed a delicate pink
at the idea.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry to hear you say that.  I hope you're wrong.
He gave me a free hand, remember."
</p>

<p>
Presently the company separated.  Mr. Huggins was
going by Sarah Jane's way, and he walked beside her; the
Churchwards went to evening worship; Jarratt disappeared
with his own anxious heart; and Mr. Weekes, hiding all
evidence of inward thought, harnessed his pony and drove
off to Lydford, to meet the train which was bringing his
wife and her baskets home from Plymouth.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br><br>
A REPRIMAND
</h3>

<p>
Now Nature thundered the hymn of the autumnal equinox;
ancient trees waved their last before it; men told of a
cloudburst, at midnight, over the central Moor.  Every river
roared in freshet; the springs overflowed and rolled down
the grassy hills, where, in summer, no water was;
cherry-coloured torrents, under banks of yellow spume, tumbled
into the valleys; storm followed upon storm, and the fall
of the year came in no peaceful guise, but like a ruthless
army.  Not until the epact did peace brood again, and fiery
dawns, pallid noons and frosty nights gave the great waste
sleeping into the hand of winter.
</p>

<p>
Daniel Brendon settled to his work, and personal regrets
that his position should be so unimportant were thrust to
the back of his mind for the present by a greater matter.
He was in love with Sarah Jane Friend, and knew it.  To
him fell the task of drawing peat with horse and cart from
Amicombe Hill, and his journeys offered not a few
opportunities of meeting with the woman.  Once at her home,
once in the peat works, he spoke with her.  On the latter
occasion she had just taken her father's dinner to him, and
after Gregory was settled with the contents of a tin can
and a little basket, Sarah proposed to Daniel that she should
show him certain secret places in this ruin.  The peat works
had been her playground as a child, and she knew every hole
and corner of them; but since silence and failure had made
the place a home, Sarah chose rather to shun it.  The very
buildings scowled, where they huddled together and cringed
to Time to spare them.  She noted this, and felt that the
place was mean and horrible, but with Dan beside her,
ancient interests wakened, and she took him to see her
haunts.
</p>

<p>
"I had a dear little cubby hole here," she said, and
showed him a great empty drum, from which one side had
fallen.
</p>

<p>
"This used to be filled with peat and be set spinning, so
that the stuff should get broke up and dried," she explained;
"but now 'tis as you see.  I've often crept in there and
gone to sleep by the hour.  'Tis full of dried heather.  An
old man that used to work with father spread it for me
five years ago.  He's dead, but the heather's there yet."
</p>

<p>
There was ample room within the huge drum even for
Brendon.  They sat together for a while, and ever afterwards
in his thought the place was consecrated to Sarah Jane.
He believed that she liked him, but her fearless attitude and
outspoken methods with men and women made him distrustful.
So weeks passed, and he gradually grew to know her
better.  After the Sunday at Lydford he went in fear and
trembling, but she said nothing about the matter, and when
he asked Mr. Friend behind her back whether indeed his
daughter was engaged, the peat-master told him that it was
not so.
</p>

<p>
"As became her father, I axed her," he said, "an' in
her usual style she told me all about it.  Jarratt Weekes
offered to wed, and set out his high prospects in a very
gentlemanlike manner; but she said neither 'yea' nor
'nay' to him.  I axed her why not, seeing as she've a
great gift of making up her mind most times&mdash;more like a
man than a woman in that respect.  But she said for once
that she wasn't sure of herself.  She'll see him again in
a month or so, and then he'll have his answer."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, I'm sure; it's very impertinent of me
presuming to ask," said Daniel, "but, to be plain with
you, Mr. Weekes, I'm terrible interested."
</p>

<p>
"So am I," answered the father.  "She's a lovely
piece&mdash;even I see that.  But it ban't a case where a parent
will do any good.  She'll take her own line, and want none
to help her decide.  If she was to go, I don't think I should
bide here."
</p>

<p>
"Would you tear yourself away from the works?"
</p>

<p>
"Go from the works!  Not likely.  But I should leave
Dunnagoat Cottage and live up there."
</p>

<p>
"Good powers!  You wouldn't do that?"
</p>

<p>
"Why for not?  Ban't no ghosts there?"
</p>

<p>
Daniel shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Your darter won't let you do it," he said.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
With a full mind, the labourer pursued his days.  How
to speak and tell her that he loved her was the problem.
He tried to fortify himself by reviewing his own prospects,
but they lent no brightness at this moment.  He had fifty
pounds saved, and was getting five-and-twenty shillings a
week&mdash;unusually good wages&mdash;but the authority he desired
seemed no nearer.  Strange thoughts passed through his
brain, and he referred them to the powers in which he
trusted.
</p>

<p>
"What's God up to with me now, I wonder?" he
asked himself.  The words were flippant, but the spirit in
which he conceived them profoundly reverent.  The
suspense and tension of the time made him rather poor
company for Agg, Lethbridge, and the widowed Joe Tapson.
Indeed, between himself and the last there had risen a
cloud.  Brendon was dictatorial in matters of farm
procedure, and by force of character won imperceptibly a little
of the control he wanted.  His love for work assisted him;
not seldom he finished another's labour, simply because he
enjoyed the task and knew that he could perform it better
than his companion.  Agg and Lethbridge were easy men,
and Daniel's hunger for toil caused them no anxiety.  They
let him assume an attitude above them, and often asked
him for help and advice; but Tapson, on the other hand,
developed a very jealous spirit.  He was ignorant and
exceedingly obstinate.  He had always regarded himself as
second in command, under Mr. Prout, and to find this
modest responsibility swept from him became a source of
great annoyance.  Twice he ventured to command Daniel,
and once the new man obeyed, because he approved
Tapson's idea; but on the second occasion he happened to be
in a bad temper, and told Joe to mind his own business and
not order his betters about.  The rebuff rankled in the
elder's bosom, and he puzzled long what course to pursue.
Agg and Lethbridge were no comfort to him.  Indeed, both
laughed at the widower's concern.
</p>

<p>
"You silly old mumphead," said the genial Walter Agg;
"what be you grizzling at?  Any man's welcome to order
me about, so long as he'll do my work for me."
</p>

<p>
"That's sound sense, an' my view to a hair," he declared.
"The chap's got strength for five men&mdash;then let
him do the work, since he's so blessed fond of it.  He's
a very fine man, an' my master any day of the week, though
he don't get much better money.  For my part I think he
ought to, and I told him so; an' he was so blessed pleased
to hear me say it, that he shifted two tons of muck, which
was my job, while I looked on, like a gentleman, till master
come into the yard!"
</p>

<p>
Agg roared with laughter.  His laugh echoed against the
stone walls of the farm, and Hilary Woodrow liked to
hear it.
</p>

<p>
"Right you are, fatty!  Dan's a very good sort, and
long may be bide here."
</p>

<p>
"You be lazy hounds, and not worth a pin, the pair of
you," answered the little man with the goat's beard.  "But
I'll not stand none of his high-handedness.  Next time I
orders him about and he pretends he don't hear, I'll have
him up afore Mr. Woodrow."
</p>

<p>
"More fool you, Joe," replied Agg.
</p>

<p>
But Mr. Tapson's intention was not fulfilled, for the
matter took a sensational turn, and when he did carry his
tribulations to head-quarters, they were of a colour more
grave than he expected.
</p>

<p>
On a day in late November Tapson was leading a cart
piled with giant swedes through one of the lowest meadows
of the farm.  The mighty roots faded from white to purple,
and drooping, glaucous foliage hung about their crowns.
Following the cart, or straggling behind it to gnaw the
turnips as he scattered them, came fifty breeding ewes.
There was a crisp sound of fat roots being munched by the
sheep.  The air hung heavy, and the day was grey and mild.
Looking up, the labourer saw Daniel Brendon approaching.
</p>

<p>
"Now for it!" thought Mr. Tapson, and his lips framed
an order.  "I'll tell the man to go and fetch me a fork
from the byre."
</p>

<p>
He was about to do so, when Brendon himself shouted
from a distance of fifty yards, and, to Tapson's amazement,
he found himself commanded.
</p>

<p>
"Get down out of thic cart an' lend a hand here, Joe.
I want 'e!"
</p>

<p>
Every line of the widower's brown face wrinkled into
wrath.  His very beard bristled.  He growled to himself,
and his solitary eye blazed.
</p>

<p>
"You want me, do 'e?" he shouted.  "You'll be
ordering up the Queen of England next, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't be a fool, and come here, quick."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Tapson permitted himself a vulgar gesture.  Then,
chattering and snorting like an angry monkey, he continued
to throw swedes upon the meadow.  Brendon hesitated and
approached.  As he did so the widower remembered his own
intention.
</p>

<p>
"You go and get me a fork from the byre; that's what
I tell you to do&mdash;so now then!" he said, as Daniel arrived.
</p>

<p>
It happened that the big man was not in a good temper.
Private anxieties fretted him exceedingly.  His way was
obscure.  He had prayed to be shown a right course with
respect to Sarah Jane, yet there dawned no definite idea.
He loved her furiously, and half suspected that she liked
him, but the miserable uncertainty and suspense of the time
weighed upon him, so that his neighbours shook their heads
behind his back and deplored his harshness.
</p>

<p>
"Be you going to do my bidding, or ban't you, Joe
Tapson?" inquired Daniel.
</p>

<p>
"Not me, you overbearing peacock!  Who be you, I
should like to know, to tell me I'm to stir foot?  Prout's
the only man above me on this farm."
</p>

<p>
Brendon considered.  He was about to express regret
that he had hurt Mr. Tapson's feelings, but Joe spoke
again, and the listener changed his mind.
</p>

<p>
"You'm a gert bully, like all you over-growed men.
Good God A'mighty!  because I had bad luck with my wife,
and was very down-trodden in my youth, and lost an eye
among other misfortunes, be that any reason why the first
bull of Bashan as comes along should order me about as if
I was the dirt under his feet?  Never was such a thing
heard of!  You'm here to work, I believe, not to talk an'
give yourself silly airs."
</p>

<p>
"If that's your opinion us had best go to master," said
Daniel.
</p>

<p>
"This instant moment, and the sooner the better!"
answered the other.
</p>

<p>
He took his horse and cart to the gate, hitched the reins
there, and walked beside Brendon into the farmyard.
Neither spoke until it happened that Hilary Woodrow met
them.  He was just going out riding, and Agg stood by with
a handsome brown mare.
</p>

<p>
Daniel and Joe both began to speak together.  Then the
master of Ruddyford silenced them, sent Agg out of earshot,
and bade Joe tell his tale.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis which he should betwixt me and this man here,"
began the elder.  "Be he to order me about, like a lost dog,
or be I set in authority over him?  That's all I want to
know, your honour.  Agg and Lethbridge do let him do
it, but I won't; I'll defy him to his face&mdash;a wise man, up
home sixty year old, like me!  'Tis a disgrace to nature
as I should go under him&mdash;as have forgot more than this
here man ever knowed, for all his vainglorious opinions!"
</p>

<p>
Woodrow nodded.
</p>

<p>
"That'll do for you, Joe.  Now go about your business.
I'll speak to Brendon."
</p>

<p>
Tapson touched his forehead and withdrew reluctantly.
He had hoped to hear his enemy roughly handled; he had
trusted to gather from his master's lips a word or two that
might be remembered and used with effect on some future
occasion.  But it was not to be.  He returned to the
swedes, and only learnt the issue some hours afterwards
from Daniel himself.
</p>

<p>
Unluckily for Brendon, Woodrow also was not in a
pleasant mood this morning.  He suffered from general
debility, for which there was no particular course, and
to-day rheumatism had returned, and was giving him some
pain in the chest and shoulders.  He rode now to see his
medical man, and felt in no mood for large sympathy or
patience.
</p>

<p>
"A few words will meet this matter," he said.  "When
you came here I told you that the sheep-dogs would be
expected to obey you, and nobody else."
</p>

<p>
"Can't we ax each other to&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"Be silent till I have spoken.  You're too fond of raising
your voice and pointing your hand.  Do your work with
less noise.  In this farm Prout's head man, and Tapson
comes under him.  With sane people there's no question
of authority at all.  All work together for the good of the
place, and all are well paid for their trouble.  But, since
you seem so anxious to command, let me tell you that I
won't have it.  You're the last to come, and you're the
least among us.  You do your work well enough, and I've no
personal fault to find; nor yet has Prout; but if you're
going to be too big for your shoes, the quicker we part the
better for both of us."
</p>

<p>
Brendon grew hot; then Sarah Jane filled his mind,
and he cooled again.  He made a mighty effort and
controlled his temper.  He was not cowed, but spoke civilly
and temperately.  Woodrow himself had kept perfectly
cool, and his example helped the labourer.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, sir," said Dan.  "I see quite clear now.
I should be very sorry indeed to leave you, and I'm very
wishful to please you.  You shan't have nothing to grumble
at again."
</p>

<p>
"That's a good fellow.  Don't think I'm blind, or so
wrapt up in my affairs that I don't watch what's doing.
You hear Tapson say all sorts of things about me, for he's
not very fond of me, though he pretends to be.  But trust
Prout before the others.  He knows me.  I'm not a godless
man, and all the rest of that rot.  Only I mind my own
business, and don't wear my heart on my sleeve.  I'm
ill to-day, or perhaps I should not have spoken so sharply.
Still, I take back nothing.  Now tell Agg to bring my horse
to the uppingstock.  Lord knows how I shall mount, for
my shoulders are one ache."
</p>

<p>
"I'll help you, please," said Daniel; and a moment
later he assisted Hilary Woodrow into the saddle.  The
farmer thanked him, groaned, then walked his horse quietly
away.
</p>

<p>
Agg looked after his master.
</p>

<p>
"Was he short with 'e?  Us have to keep our weather
eyes lifting when he's sick."
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," answered Brendon.  "He only told me a
thing or two I'd forgotten."
</p>

<p>
"Ban't much you forget, I reckon," answered the red
man.  Then he went his way, and Brendon returned to
his work and his reflections.
</p>

<p>
He felt no anger at this reprimand.  He was surprised
with himself to find how placid he remained under it.  But
he knew the reason.  His subordinate position was as
nothing weighed against the possibility of leaving Sarah
Jane.  He quickly came to a conclusion with himself, and
determined, at any cost of disappointment, to speak to her
and ask her to marry him.  If she refused, he would quit
Ruddyford; if she accepted him, he would stay there&mdash;for
the present.  His mind became much quieted upon this
decision, and he found leisure to reflect concerning his
master.  Woodrow had been curiously communicative at the
recent interview, and his confession concerning himself
interested his man.  From Daniel's point of view the farmer's
life was godless, for he never obeyed any outward
regulations, and openly declared himself of no Christian
persuasion.  Yet his days were well ordered, and he neither
openly erred nor offended anybody.  Brendon wondered
upon what foundation Mr. Woodrow based his scheme of
conduct, and whither he looked for help and counsel.  That
man can trust reason to sustain his footsteps he knew not;
and, indeed, at that date, to find one of Woodrow's
education and breeding strongly sceptical of mind was a
phenomenon.  Such, however, had been his bent, and, like
many others who turn strongly by instinct from all dogmas,
the farmer yet found ethics an attractive subject, and
sharpened his intellect daily with such books as upheld
reason against faith.  He was self-conscious concerning his
unorthodox opinions, but secretly felt proud of them.  Fifty
years ago, to be agnostic was to be without the pale.  None
trusted Woodrow, and religious-minded folk resented his
existence.  The local clergymen would not know him.
Perhaps only one man, John Prout, stood stoutly for him in
the face of all people, and declared that he could do no
wrong.
</p>

<p>
That night Brendon smoked his pipe in a cart-shed and
spoke to Mr. Tapson.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry I ordered you to come to me, Joe," he said,
"and I'm sorrier still that I didn't get the fork when you
told me to do it.  Master's made all clear to me.  Prout's
head man and you're second&mdash;so there it stands; and you
shan't have no call to find fault again."
</p>

<p>
"Enough said," answered the other.  "Us must all
stand up for ourselves in this world, Brendon, because
there's nobody else to do it.  Therefore I up and spoke.
But I'm very desirous to be friends, and I know your good
parts."
</p>

<p>
"So be it then," answered Daniel.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br><br>
THE COMMITTEE MEETS
</h3>

<p>
Mr. Churchward found some difficulty in arranging a
representative committee to consider the water leat
celebrations.  Many refused to join him&mdash;among others
Woodrow.  To the master of Ruddyford he wrote, in his expansive
way, and begged that he would "represent the outlying
agricultural interests"; but Hilary declined, and John
Prout consented to fill his place.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis all smoke and wind, no doubt, but 'twill please
the man," he said.
</p>

<p>
There met together at the schoolmaster's house Jarratt
Weekes, old Valentine Huggins, Noah Pearn&mdash;the landlord
of the Castle Inn&mdash;John Prout, and two others&mdash;men of
repute in Lydford.  They were the miller, Jacob Taverner,
and the postmaster, a weak and pink-eyed person, called
Nathaniel Spry.  Him Mr. Churchward regarded as a
satellite, and patronized in a manner at once unctuous and
august.
</p>

<p>
Weekes opened the proceedings while the men were
getting out of their coats.
</p>

<p>
"Is Squire Calmady coming?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I regret to say that he is not," answered the schoolmaster.
"I approached him <i>in propriâ personâ</i> by letter,
and he replied that the meeting would be very safe in our
hands.  I hope you all think the same.  Anyhow, we have
paid him the compliment; we can do no more."
</p>

<p>
"There's no gentlefolks on the committee, then?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Taverner, who was a stout radical, and saturated with
class prejudice, resented this suggestion.
</p>

<p>
"Gentle or not gentle, Jarratt Weekes, we are all pretty
solid men, and know how to behave, I believe."
</p>

<p>
"I vote Mr. Churchward into the chair, neighbours,"
said the postmaster.  "Then we shall have wisdom over
the committee."
</p>

<p>
Adam bridled, but held up his hand in a deprecating
manner.
</p>

<p>
"I want no power&mdash;nothing of the sort.  I'm only your
servant in this matter.  But since somebody must&mdash;in fact,
I leave myself in your hands."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis your own house, so you'd better take the lead, and
I'll second the motion," declared John Prout.
</p>

<p>
"Shall us smoke, or would it be out of order?" asked
the landlord of the Castle Inn.
</p>

<p>
Spry looked imploringly at the schoolmaster.  He hated
the smell of tobacco, and suffered from a nervous cough.
But Mr. Churchward liked his pipe as well as smaller men,
and he declared for smoke.
</p>

<p>
"I've a new box of 'churchwardens' in this drawer,"
he said.  "I beg the committee will make free with them.
Now&mdash;but where's Mr. Norseman?  Speaking the word
'churchwarden' reminded me of him.  We want him to
complete the committee."
</p>

<p>
The official in question almost immediately joined them.
Henry Norseman was a swarthy, black-bearded, sanctimonious
man, the factor of important estates, and churchwarden
of the people.
</p>

<p>
They sat round the table that Mr. Churchward had cleared
for them.  Pens and paper were arranged upon it, and the
box of clay pipes stood in the midst.  A fire burnt on the
hearth, and two oil lamps gave light.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a very comfortable committee, I'm sure," said
Mr. Huggins, stretching for a tobacco pipe, and bringing
a flat metal box from his trouser pocket to fill it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Churchward opened the proceedings.
</p>

<p>
"What we have to decide is the sort of thing we are going
to do the day the water comes into Lydford.  I have my
idea, but I am quite prepared to submit it <i>sub rosa</i>.  If
anybody has a better one, I shall be the first to agree thereto.
Now my notion is a public holiday and a procession.  This
procession should start from the high road and walk through
Lydford down to Little Lydford, and back.  At a foot's
pace 'twould take not above three hours."
</p>

<p>
"And I propose that the procession stops at the Castle
Inn on the way back," said Mr. Pearn.
</p>

<p>
"Why?" asked Jarratt Weekes, pointedly, and the
publican bristled up.
</p>

<p>
"Why do people stop at an inn?" he asked, in his
turn.  "That's a damn silly question, if ever I heard
one."
</p>

<p>
"You're out of order," retorted Weekes.  "Though, of
course, we all know very well your meaning."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Pearn lifted his chin very high.
</p>

<p>
"All right, all right!" he said.  "What d'you want to
open your mouth so wide for?  I suppose every man of this
committee has a right to be heard?  And I suppose we've
all got an axe to grind, else we shouldn't be here?"
</p>

<p>
"You'll have your say in due course, Noah Pearn.
Don't waste the committee's time interrupting," said
Mr. Prout.
</p>

<p>
But the landlord proceeded.
</p>

<p>
"I'm the last to want to waste anybody's time&mdash;know
the value of time too well.  But this I will say, that I'll
give a free lunch to fifty people on the day&mdash;three courses,
and hot joints with the first&mdash;if 'tis understood everyone
pays for his own drinks.  That's my offer; take it or leave
it.  So now then!"
</p>

<p>
"I was going to say 'order'; but, since you submit a
definite proposal, I won't, Mr. Pearn.  Well, that seems a
patriotic offer&mdash;eh, gentlemen?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Churchward glanced about him and caught Mr. Henry
Norseman's eye.
</p>

<p>
"We ought to vote on that," declared the churchwarden.
</p>

<p>
"I'm against liquor, as you know, and cannot support the
idea, owing to conscience."
</p>

<p>
"No good voting&mdash;I don't care what you vote, and I
don't care for a teetotaler's conscience.  Take it or leave
it.  Free lunches for fifty, and them as drinks pays for it,"
repeated Mr. Pearn.
</p>

<p>
"I advise the committee to accept that," said the miller
Taverner.  "'Tis a public-spirited offer, and if Noah does
well out of the beer, why shouldn't he?  In fact, I second
it."
</p>

<p>
"Are we agreed?" asked Mr. Churchward, and all held
up a hand but Mr. Norseman.  The publican resented his
attitude as a personal slight.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you come to fill your belly with my free lunch,
then&mdash;that's all, for you won't be served," he said, furiously.
</p>

<p>
"Have no fear," answered the other.  "I never support
drink, and never shall, Mr. Pearn."
</p>

<p>
"Order&mdash;order!" cried the chairman.  "The free lunch
is carried.  Now, neighbours, please hear me.  The first
thing to decide is, shall we or shall we not have a
procession?  If any man can think of a better idea, let him
speak."
</p>

<p>
"Impossible," declared the postmaster.  "You have hit
on exactly the right thing, Mr. Chairman.  A procession
is the highest invention the human mind can ever reach on
great occasions, and the most famous events of the world,
from ancient times downwards, are always marked so.  The
bigger the affair, the longer the procession.  History is
simply packed full of them."
</p>

<p>
"Hear, hear, Spry!" said Mr. Taverner.  "And what
the postmaster says is true.  'Tis always a solemn sight to
see men walking two by two, whether they be worthies of
the nation or mere convicts chained together."
</p>

<p>
The committee, without a dissentient voice, agreed to
a procession, and Mr. Churchward was much gratified.  He
bowed from the chair.
</p>

<p>
"I'm very pleased to have been the humble instrument
of expressing your views in a word, gentlemen," he began.
"And now arises the question of the nature of the pageant."
</p>

<p>
"The Goose Club might walk, for one thing," suggested
Mr. Prout.
</p>

<p>
"It shall," answered Pearn; "as the president of the
Goose Club, I can promise that."
</p>

<p>
"And I'll speak for the Ancient Dartymoor Druids&mdash;Lydford
Branch," said Jacob Taverner.  "But I won't
promise the banner if the day be wet.  It cost three pounds,
and wouldn't stand weather."
</p>

<p>
"That's very good to begin with, I'm sure," declared
Mr. Churchward; then old Huggins made his first
contribution to the debate.
</p>

<p>
"Us must have brass moosic, souls.  There's nought like
trumpets&mdash;they'll carry off anything.  I mind when Jimmy
Briggs was buried there never was a poorer funeral&mdash;nought
but five or six humble creatures behind, and me an' a few
other men to carry him.  But, just as we stopped to change
hands, what should go by but a four-hoss coach!  And the
guard didn't see us, and blowed a sudden blast as would
sartainly have made us drop the carpse if he hadn't been on
the ground for the moment.  But there 'twas; it gave a
great grandeur to the scene, and comforted the mourners,
like the Trump of Doom."
</p>

<p>
"Brass music, of course," said Jarratt Weekes.  "The
Okehampton Yeomanry band is very good, and their black
and silver uniforms would look fine in the show."
</p>

<p>
"They'll cost a pot of money; that's the worst of them,"
said the postmaster.
</p>

<p>
"As to that, my dear Spry, we must, of course, approach
the subject in a large and hopeful spirit.  When everything
is arranged I shall propose an appeal to the district.  I
have thought of this, too, and, I consider, if we can collect
thirty to forty pounds, that should cover all expenses."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Churchward it was who spoke.
</p>

<p>
"You'll never get as much as that&mdash;or half of it,"
declared Weekes.  "What are you going to show 'em for
the money?"
</p>

<p>
"That's the point.  I propose&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Taverner, who had been whispering with Mr. Pearn,
interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me if I'm not in order; but I beg to say that
talking's dry work, and I should like for to ask if we may
send round to the 'Castle' for a quart or two?"
</p>

<p>
The chairman looked round him.
</p>

<p>
"Agreed," said Mr. Prout.  "I second that."
</p>

<p>
"I've no objection in the world," declared Mr. Churchward.
</p>

<p>
"I should have suggested it myself," remarked Noah
Pearn; "but for obvious reasons, gentlemen, I couldn't."
</p>

<p>
They applauded his delicate feeling, and Adam spoke to
Nathaniel Spry.
</p>

<p>
"If you walk across to the inn, Nat, you'll find my son
in the bar for certain," he said.  "Just tell him to fetch
over two quarts of mild, and write it down to me; and put
on your overcoat afore you go, for the night is sharp."
</p>

<p>
"And I'll ask for a bottle of lemonade, if there's no
objection," added Mr. Norseman.
</p>

<p>
The publican was mollified at this order, and while the
others talked, he turned to his former enemy.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you'll not think twice of what I said, and come
to my free lunch with the rest, Henry Norseman," he said.
</p>

<p>
The other nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Plenty of time, plenty of time," he answered.
</p>

<p>
"I can't sit cool and hear beer attacked," explained
Mr. Pearn.  "As a man of reason, you must see that."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, certainly.  I'm not unreasonable&mdash;I'm
large-minded even over beer, I believe.  If we must have
it&mdash;poison though it is&mdash;let us have it good."
</p>

<p>
"And the man who says he ever got bad beer at my
house is a liar," concluded Mr. Pearn.
</p>

<p>
The schoolmaster rapped on the table and resumed the
main discussion.
</p>

<p>
"Now as to this procession," he began.  "We must
have features.  I believe I am allowed some claim to be
original in my ideas.  Indeed, I am too much so, and even
in the scholastic line, find myself rather ahead of the times.
But with a procession, what can be better than originality?
Then I say we must have some impersonations&mdash;historic
characters&mdash;to walk in procession.  They must be
allegorical and typical, and, in fact, emblematical."
</p>

<p>
He paused for breath just as Mr. Spry returned.
</p>

<p>
"William's going to bring the beer to the committee in
five minutes," said he.
</p>

<p>
"You've missed some long words, postmaster," remarked
Mr. Taverner.  "The chairman here have got a great
thought for the procession.  'Twill be better than the
riders,[<a id="chap0109fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0109fn1">1</a>] if it can be done."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0109fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap0109fn1text">1</a>] <i>The Riders</i>, a circus.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Allegorical, emblematical, <i>et hoc genus omne</i>," declared
Mr. Churchward, and mopped his forehead.
</p>

<p>
"Trust schoolmaster to make a regular, valiant revel of
it," said Mr. Huggins.  "'Twill be very near as good as
Wombwell's beast show, if the committee only stands by
Mr. Churchward to a man."
</p>

<p>
"Have you thought who the great characters should be?"
asked Henry Norseman doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"I may have done so, churchwarden," answered the
chairman; "but that's for us in committee.  We must argue
upon it.  I invite you all to give your ideas; and what poor
knowledge of history I may possess is at your service."
</p>

<p>
"St. George for one," said Jarratt Weekes; and
everybody looked at Mr. Churchward.
</p>

<p>
He considered and nodded his head with gravity.  The
propriety of the idea was obvious; but Adam disliked the
younger Weekes and grudged him credit.
</p>

<p>
"The patron Saint of England&mdash;eh?  Well, there's no
objection to him, certainly," he said, but without
enthusiasm; and Jarratt instantly made his annoyance clear.
</p>

<p>
"Objection to St. George!  Good God!  I should think
there wasn't any objection to St. George!  What next, I
wonder?  If St. George ban't done, I'll leave the
committee&mdash;so I tell you.  You're glumpy because you didn't think
of the man yourself!"
</p>

<p>
"Order! order!" cried Mr. Churchward.  "Far be it
from me to cast any slur on the name of St. George.  But
there are so many other notable personages to consider;
and as I am of opinion that we can hardly manage more
than five or six at the outside, I felt doubtful.  However,
let us have St. George by all means.  Those in favour of
St. George will kindly signify the same in the usual
manner."
</p>

<p>
St. George was honoured with a unanimous vote.  Then
Mr. Huggins piped in.
</p>

<p>
"And do let's have the old dragon, souls!  St. Garge be
nought without un."
</p>

<p>
"The dragon!  The dragon, Huggins?" asked Mr. Churchward.
"That's rather startling&mdash;and yet&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly the dragon," said Mr. Prout firmly; "Valentine's
right there."
</p>

<p>
"'The Infant' might play dragon very nice," suggested
Mr. Pearn.
</p>

<p>
"Not he&mdash;too fat," declared Jarratt Weekes brutally;
and William Churchward's father was a good deal hurt.
</p>

<p>
"My son is not too fat," he answered.  "William may
be stout; but I imagine a prosperous dragon would be
stout, for that matter.  Wasn't St. George's dragon prosperous
before he met St. George, Mr. Spry?  You are pretty
well up in the heathen mythology, I believe."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you for that kind word, schoolmaster," said
Spry.  "And he was prosperous.  'Tis all a fable, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
At this moment William Churchward entered.  He was a
huge, burly, thick-necked young man with a voice that
surprised the ear.  One expected a solemn bass and heard
a ridiculous treble.  William had bulbous, pale grey eyes
like his father's, flabby chops and a small mouth.
</p>

<p>
"There's your beer," he said.  "Good Lord! you old
blades be going it seemingly."
</p>

<p>
"Would you play dragon, 'Infant,' and let St. Garge
pretend to stick his spear into 'e?" asked Mr. Huggins.
</p>

<p>
"Us be going to have a dragon in the procession&mdash;with
St. George a slaying of him, William," explained Mr. Prout.
</p>

<p>
"The 'Infant' will never let himself be slain, I'm
afraid?" murmured Nathaniel Spry in a questioning voice.
</p>

<p>
"You'll have to wear an outrageous tail, William, an'
cover your gert carcase in glittering scales," declared Jacob
Taverner.  "But I don't think you ought to be allowed to
roar, for you haven't got a dragon's voice&mdash;to say it kindly."
</p>

<p>
"'Twill come down to play-acting in a minute," grumbled
Mr. Norseman, "and I don't hold with that, I warn the
committee.  If there's to be any May games of that sort,
I'll lay it afore the vicar."
</p>

<p>
William helped himself to a churchwarden from the box,
and prepared to depart.
</p>

<p>
"You'm a rare old rally," he said; "and all drunk
a'ready, I should think."
</p>

<p>
"You don't follow the course of the argument, my son,"
explained his father.  "However, I'll make it clear at
another time.  You mustn't stop now, because we are in
committee, and it would be irregular."
</p>

<p>
"Bless you nose, I don't want to stop!" replied William.
Then he made a mock bow and departed.
</p>

<p>
When he had gone, Mr. Spry, who was a peace-loving
man, proposed that they should drop the dragon.  Pearn,
Prout and Taverner, however, held out for the monster
loudly, and Mr. Huggins supported them.
</p>

<p>
"Better have a sub-committee to decide," sneered Jarratt
Weekes; but Mr. Churchward ignored his satire and put
the question to the vote.
</p>

<p>
"Dragon romps home!" cried John Prout.
</p>

<p>
"St. George and the Dragon have passed the committee,"
announced Mr. Churchward.  "And now, gentlemen,
perhaps you'll kindly help yourselves."
</p>

<p>
There was an interval of clinking glasses and bubbling
liquor.  A smell of beer permeated the chamber.
</p>

<p>
"All's going wonderful well," sighed Mr. Huggins.
"I hope we haven't nearly finished yet."
</p>

<p>
Presently the discussion was resumed.
</p>

<p>
"With your permission, I will now myself submit a
character," said the chairman, "and it is no less a solemn
figure than the patriarch Moses."
</p>

<p>
"Your reasons?" asked Jarratt Weekes sharply.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Churchward flushed, but was not disconcerted.
</p>

<p>
"Moses brought forth water from the rock.  It would
be symbolical and religious to have him in the procession.
We've brought forth water from the rock.  There you are&mdash;an
allegory in fact."
</p>

<p>
"You couldn't have hit on a higher idea in history,
schoolmaster," asserted Nathaniel Spry.
</p>

<p>
"There's no offence?" asked Mr. Norseman.  "You're
sure there's no offence, schoolmaster?  You know what his
reverence is."
</p>

<p>
"I do," answered the chairman.  "And I also know
what I am.  I believe that, when it comes to decorum,
Mr. Norseman, I am generally allowed to be <i>facile princeps</i>.  If
I am wrong I hope somebody will correct me."
</p>

<p>
Jarratt Weekes uttered a contemptuous sound into his
glass as he drained it; then old Huggins spoke.
</p>

<p>
His voice was tremulous, and he evidently laboured under
great suppressed excitement.
</p>

<p>
"I do beg and pray of the committee as you'll let me be
Moses, souls!  I'm old enough&mdash;up home fourscore to a
week&mdash;just the man's age when he denied and defied King
Pharaoh.  An' my beard's a regular Moses beard; an' I'm
accounted wise to the eye, so long as I keep my mouth shut.
'Twould be the first and last act of note that ever I should
do, an' a very fine thing to be handed down in my favour
for my grandchildren to remember."
</p>

<p>
There was an awkward silence.  Mr. Prout and the
schoolmaster whispered aside, Mr. Norseman and
Mr. Taverner shook their heads.
</p>

<p>
"Let him&mdash;let the old blid do it," said John Prout under
his breath.  "Might be a gracious act.  He couldn't mar
it, if he said nought."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Spry also whispered into the chairman's ear.
</p>

<p>
"Does he bear himself straight enough in the back?
That's my fear.  And the stone tables&mdash;he'd droop to the
ground under them."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Huggins pleaded again.
</p>

<p>
"I'd wear the holy horns on my brow and everything;
and many a married man would rather not.  But 'tis nought
to me."
</p>

<p>
"I had thought to write speeches in character for the
emblematical people, and perhaps some verses," said
Churchward; whereupon the face of the aged Huggins fell.
</p>

<p>
"Don't ax me to say nought," he begged.  "Even as
'tis, if I walk as Moses, I shall be sweating for fear under
my sacred coat; and if I had to tell a speech, I should
disgrace myself and the company without a doubt."
</p>

<p>
"I'm against speeches altogether," declared Jarratt
Weekes; "and so's Mr. Norseman here.  We won't have
no play-acting and no chattering of silly verses."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Churchward glared at his foe, and Weekes glared
back and poured out more beer.  The chairman thought of
certain rhymes already in his desk, and Mr. Spry, who
knew of these rhymes, cast a timorous and sympathetic eye
at his gloomy friend.
</p>

<p>
"Schoolmaster's made some beautiful speeches, that
nobody here could mend, for he's been so very good as to
let me read them," he said.
</p>

<p>
But the sense of the meeting was for a dumb show; Mr. Huggins
had his way and became self-conscious and nervous
from that moment.  Like greater men, he won his ambition
and lost his peace of mind for evermore.
</p>

<p>
Sir Francis Drake, who brought water from Dartmoor to
Plymouth, was suggested by the postmaster and agreed
upon with enthusiasm; then Mr. Churchward proposed a
Druid and Mr. Spry seconded, but Norseman protested.
</p>

<p>
"No heathen&mdash;no heathen!" he said.  "'Twould be a
reproach and make us a byword.  Let's have St. Petrock&mdash;him
that our church be named after.  He might travel
side by side of Moses, and keep the show well within
Christianity."
</p>

<p>
"St. Petrock is good," declared Adam Churchward.
"St. Petrock is a thought worthy of you, Norseman.  Spry
and I will consult our books about him.  I second that,
certainly."
</p>

<p>
The drink was done, and Mr. Pearn, aware that his part
in the debate had sunk to nothing, advanced an idea.
</p>

<p>
"Why for shouldn't us have a lady hero?  How would
it be, Mr. Chairman, if Jezebel, Queen of Sheba, went
among 'em?"
</p>

<p>
"Jezebel wasn't Queen of Sheba," answered several
voices simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
"Not?" exclaimed the publican.  "There now!  If I
didn't always think she was."
</p>

<p>
"You should read your Bible better, Noah Pearn," said
Mr. Norseman; "and I object to women displaying
themselves in the show at all."
</p>

<p>
"Churchwarden's right: don't have no women," advised
John Prout.  "They'm not fitted in their intellects to stand
the strain of a public procession without getting too
overbearing.  They'm better kept under, in my opinion.  You
might lift up some comely maiden and turn her head for
all time by it."
</p>

<p>
"If we had a queen at all, it should be Queen Elizabeth,"
said Mr. Churchward.
</p>

<p>
"Why?" asked Weekes.
</p>

<p>
"To walk along with Sir Francis Drake," answered the
postmaster promptly.  "That's sound history and sound
sense."
</p>

<p>
"Don't have no queens," urged Mr. Prout.  "Mark
me, they'll spoil all with their giggling and nonsense."
</p>

<p>
"How be the heroes going to travel?" inquired Taverner.
"For my part I think a hay-wain would be best.  They'll
get in a jakes of a mess if they go afoot down to Little
Lydford.  You know what the road is, even in dry
weather."
</p>

<p>
"<i>C[oe]teris paribus</i>," answered Mr. Churchward thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Very likely," admitted Taverner, "but, all the same,
a hay-wain will be best."
</p>

<p>
Then it was that Jarratt Weekes allowed his gathering
anger to bubble forth in a very acute explosion.
</p>

<p>
"Why the hell can't you talk English?" he asked the
chairman.  "I'm sick to death of your bumbling noise.
Whenever you don't know what the deuce to answer a man,
you fall back on some jargon, that may be Latin, or may be
gibberish more likely.  You don't know any more than us
what your twaddle signifies; but you know we can't laugh
at you, and so you're safe to pretend a lot of larning you
haven't got.  What does <i>c[oe]teris paribus</i> mean, anyway?&mdash;I
ask you that afore this committee, and I will be answered!"
</p>

<p>
The chairman grew red and blew a heavy blast through
his nostrils.  Mr. Spry cried out "Shame&mdash;shame!";
Mr. Huggins was frightened.
</p>

<p>
"The committee is adjourned," answered Adam very
haughtily.  "And for the benefit of those who have so little
education, and who envy those who may be better endowed
in that respect, I may remark that <i>c[oe]teris paribus</i> means&mdash;it
means, in the manner in which I employed it, that the question
of a hay-wain shall be decided at the next meeting.  And
that is all I have to say, except that I expect an apology."
</p>

<p>
"And all I have to say is that you won't get one,"
answered Mr. Weekes very rudely.
</p>

<p>
The company rose, and a date having been appointed for
future deliberations, every man prepared to go on his way.
</p>

<p>
Jarratt Weekes refused to apologize, despite efforts on the
part of Prout and Norseman to make him do so.  He
persisted in the display of a very ferocious temper, and
expressed grave doubt as to whether he should again join the
committee.  None pressed him to do so.
</p>

<p>
"A beautiful meeting," said Mr. Huggins to Mr. Taverner,
who saw him home.  "I'm sure I hope I shall be
spared to see many more such afore the great day cometh."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br><br>
"DARLING BLUE-EYES!"
</h3>

<p>
Daniel Brendon asked Sarah Jane to marry him on an
afternoon in November, when the wind blew like a giant
from the west, and the life of the Moor slept.
</p>

<p>
They sat in a nook of Great Links Tor, looked at the
world outspread beneath them, and listened to the hiss of
the wind, as it flogged heath and stone and chattering
rushes.  A million tiny clouds dappled the sky with pure
pearl, and far beneath this apparently motionless cloth of
silver was woven another cloud-pattern of darker tone,
where tattered vapour fled easterly across heaven before the
roaring breeze.  This rack sank to earth's surface, swept
the Moor, and, when it reached the crowns of the land,
swallowed them.  Thus a world of wild movement and music
filled the lower air and throbbed upon the wilderness, while
the upper chambers of the sky were bright and still.  Some
faint sunlight pierced the cirrus, but its radiance was caught
by the turmoil below and hardly reached these lovers, where
they sat sheltered from the riotous breath of the wind.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-084"></a>
<br>

GREAT LINKS
</p>

<p>
Daniel had asked for a half-holiday, and Sarah met him
by appointment in this most lofty, most lonely place.
</p>

<p>
He had rehearsed his words many times until his brain
whirled.  By night the statement was clear, and phrases
that seemed good to him thronged up from heart to tongue.
With day they vanished, and now, on the threshold of the
supreme moment, not a shadow of all his fine ideas remained.
The wind from the Atlantic swept the last thought away.
He sat by her, heaved immense sighs, panted dumb as the
stone and heather, fixed his gaze upon her placid face.
</p>

<p>
"You'm blowing like the wind's self," said Sarah.
</p>

<p>
"I know I be," he answered.  "There's times when I
find mouth-speech terrible difficult, and this be one of them."
</p>

<p>
She knew very well what Daniel must now find words
to tell her, but for once love was stronger than herself.
When a halting blacksmith had nearly choked with a
proposal in the past, she had helped him out of his misery as
swiftly as possible, so that there might be little delay before
the fatal word fell on his ears; but to-day the case was
altered.  She enjoyed the discomfort of her dear one's
struggle, because her answer must presently make him forget
his tribulation, as a warm fire makes us forget battle with
the cold air outside.
</p>

<p>
"You don't talk enough to be very clever at it," she
said.  "'Tis the little, peart men talk best, like the small
birds sing best.  You gert big chaps croak like the
crows&mdash;just now and again.  You can't keep it up."
</p>

<p>
"Very true, I'm sure.  But I don't want to croak now,
God knows.  If I was to put it in shape of a prayer, 'twould
come easy, for you'd be surprised how my words slip out
then.  It loosens the tongue something wonderful to ax
God for anything.  He helps."
</p>

<p>
"You don't say your prayers out loud, however&mdash;else
everybody to Ruddyford would hear 'em&mdash;with your gert
voice."
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;I whisper 'em.  But no man can pray to anybody
but his Maker.  So it's cruel difficult."
</p>

<p>
"Who is it you'm fretting to speak to, then?  Be you
shamed to do it?  Be it an uncomely thing?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no&mdash;'tis a very every-day thing; and yet not
that&mdash;'tis a&mdash;&mdash;  Would I say anything to you that weren't
comely?"
</p>

<p>
"To me?"
</p>

<p>
"To you&mdash;yes."
</p>

<p>
"Whatever should you have to say to me?"
</p>

<p>
"Things as I haven't got the language for.  There's
words&mdash;like 'marriage,' for instance&mdash;that be an awful
mouthful to spit out.  Worse than having a tooth drawed.
Yet there's no other word for it."
</p>

<p>
"And what's the hard word you can't bring yourself to say?"
</p>

<p>
"Look here&mdash;listen.  There are some things that I can
say, and they'll do for a start.  I'm a terrible poor man.
I've only got fifty pound stored up, but it goodies and it
will be fifty-four ten by next March.  I get twenty-five
shillings a week; and that's very tidy indeed for me.  Yet
I'm worth it&mdash;not to despise myself&mdash;and I've great hopes
of getting up higher.  You'll think I'm a very own-self
man, to keep on about myself so much."
</p>

<p>
"Not at all.  'Tis cruel interesting."
</p>

<p>
"Very kind to say so."
</p>

<p>
"Well, what next?"
</p>

<p>
"Should you reckon that was a promising case, or maybe
you don't?"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a very common state of things&mdash;save for the
fifty-four pounds ten."
</p>

<p>
"You'd reckon that was to the good, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Every penny of it."
</p>

<p>
"It took some saving, Sarah Jane."
</p>

<p>
"I lay it did, Daniel Brendon."
</p>

<p>
"And I'm putting by a nice bit every week now."
</p>

<p>
"So you ought to be.  You never know."
</p>

<p>
There was silence between them, but the wind ceased
not.  Then she relented and made it easy for him.
</p>

<p>
"I say you never know; because presently you'll be
sure to see a girl that you'll like.  No doubt you think not;
but you will."
</p>

<p>
"I have&mdash;I have!"
</p>

<p>
She hardened her heart again.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  So soon?  Well, if I may give you advice, you
lie low till that fifty's up in three figures.  Then&mdash;very
like she'll take 'e, if nobody better comes in the
meantime."
</p>

<p>
She looked at him and saw his face grow long and his
jaw droop.
</p>

<p>
Then she suddenly threw her arms round him.
</p>

<p>
"You dear, great monster!" she said.
</p>

<p>
"Eh&mdash;what!  Good God!" cried the man; and his
emotion heaved up, slow and mighty, like the swing of a
wave.  He could say nothing; but he kept her face close
to his and kissed her pale hair; then his arms tightened
round her, and she felt the immense strength of them, and
the great uplift of his ribs against her breast.
</p>

<p>
"I can't let 'e go; I'll never let 'e go again, I do
believe," he said at last.
</p>

<p>
She knew he was unconsciously bruising her white body,
but let him hug.
</p>

<p>
"My darling Blue-eyes!" he cried out, "what have I
done to deserve this?"
</p>

<p>
"Made me love you."
</p>

<p>
"Think of it&mdash;think of it!  When did you begin?"
</p>

<p>
"When did you?"
</p>

<p>
"First moment that ever I set eyes on you.  When I
walked down-along, after seeing you and drinking the cider
you poured out for me, I knocked my knees against the
rocks, like a blind sheep, for I couldn't think of nothing
but your lovely hair."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis too pale.  What d'you suppose I said to myself
when I seed you first?"
</p>

<p>
His arm had settled to her waist.  She rubbed her ear
against his cheek.
</p>

<p>
"I said, 'I'll get that chap to take off them little funny
three-cornered whiskers, if I can.  They spoil the greatness
of his beautiful, brown face."
</p>

<p>
"Did you think that&mdash;honour bright?"
</p>

<p>
"Honour bright, I did."
</p>

<p>
"I'll chop 'em off afore I see you again!"
</p>

<p>
He kissed her on the mouth.
</p>

<p>
"I never thought I could be so happy as this, Daniel,"
she said.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis almost too much," he admitted.  "I doubt if any
two was ever heart an' soul together like this afore.  Feel
me&mdash;fire&mdash;fire&mdash;burning like the bush in the wilderness, and
yet not burning away!  An' Him up above the clouds&mdash;to
think it all out for us and plan it so loving and merciful!
Bless God for His great goodness, darling Blue-eyes!  This
be all His work and His thought."
</p>

<p>
She showed no religious enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
"Leave God till after," she said.  "Go on burning now.
Love me, hug me.  There'll be black and blue bruises on
my arms to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"I'll make you love God in a way you haven't come to
yet, Sarah Jane."
</p>

<p>
"Don't drag God in now," she said.  "Talk to me,
cuddle me.  Tell me about what we're going to do when
we'm married.  Think of it all round&mdash;the astonishment&mdash;the
fun.  My father first&mdash;and then the castle-keeper.  He'll
have the flesh off your gert bones for this!  Talk&mdash;talk&mdash;hug
me tight and talk!"
</p>

<p>
"I want to think&mdash;I want to think," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Don't," she answered.  "Feeling is better than
thinking any day."
</p>

<p>
They lived through an hour as though it had been a
moment.  They did not feel the gathering dusk; they did
not hear the wind.  The rain fell presently, and to Sarah
it seemed to hiss as it touched Daniel's cheek.
</p>

<p>
She leapt up at last.
</p>

<p>
"Now us'll go straight home and tell father."
</p>

<p>
"To-day&mdash;must we?"
</p>

<p>
"In course.  You needn't fear it.  It won't surprise him
over much."
</p>

<p>
As they returned, he spoke again of the goodness of his
watchful Creator, and moralized upon it.
</p>

<p>
"He does so much for us&mdash;He is sleepless&mdash;always
watching and thinking for us worms....  And what can
we do to pay Him?  Nothing.  We can only thank Him
in our hearts every hour of the day."
</p>

<p>
Sarah Jane was silent a moment&mdash;then broke out suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want you to fawn on God about me, Daniel."
</p>

<p>
He started.
</p>

<p>
"What do you say, my darling dear?"
</p>

<p>
"Us don't think all alike there.  I hate a mean spirit in
a man.  Not that you've got one&mdash;far, far from that.  But
I hate even a dog that cringes; and maybe God thinks the
same of a man that does."
</p>

<p>
"Can we cringe to the Almighty?"
</p>

<p>
"The Giver's more than the gift to you, perhaps?"
</p>

<p>
"Nought on earth could be more than the gift, and well
you know it!  But&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I've given myself to you.  I've done it myself&mdash;out of
my own heart," she cried almost passionately.
</p>

<p>
He did not argue the point, but put his arms round her
again.  Yet he pondered as they passed on to Dunnagoat
Cottage; and presently she startled him once more.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Friend took the news in a spirit very stoical.
</p>

<p>
"It had to come: 'twas only a question of time.  I've
always knowed that," he said.  "I'm going to bargain for
a fair spell of keeping company afore you do the rash deed.
You catched fire from each other the first moment you met,
I do believe.  But sometimes the love that's soon ripe is
soon rotten.  So you'll just larn a bit about each other and
we'll talk of marrying presently, when there's a foundation
of understanding and knowledge built up between you."
</p>

<p>
"I know Dan to the very soul of him," said Sarah Jane.
"I've read him day by day like a book of large, easy print;
and he knows me&mdash;better than I know myself&mdash;don't you,
Daniel?"
</p>

<p>
Brendon grinned doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"I know you're the best, beautifullest wonder of a woman
as ever I met with; and I know that I ban't worthy to tie
your shoe-string; and that's about all I do know," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Exactly so!" declared Gregory.  Then he took his
daughter's face between his hands and kissed her.
</p>

<p>
"Bless you, you bowerly maid.  You know nought about
her, man; and I&mdash;her own parent&mdash;don't know much more;
and she herself&mdash;what do she know, but that she's born&mdash;and
loves you?  There's as much we don't know, and she
don't know, behind them blue eyes of hers, as there is
behind the blue sky.  Mark that; an' the Lord bless you,
I'm sure; and if all goes well, I shall be pleased to have
you for a son-in-law."
</p>

<p>
"I hope you'll never get no cause to regret them words,
Mr. Friend.  And, God helping, I'll Be a useful son to you
as the years go on."
</p>

<p>
"That's a very proper thing to say.  And if I have any
opinion in the matter, 'tis this, that you won't take her too
far off from me.  She must bide fairly close.  She's all I've
got, and I couldn't go on without seeing her from time to
time."
</p>

<p>
"That I will promise."
</p>

<p>
They fell into long silences while Gregory's daughter made
tea; then they ate and drank and talked more freely again.
</p>

<p>
The lovers began to plan daily meetings; and Sarah Jane
allowed herself to think deliciously of all the friends to
whom this great news must be broken.  Daniel remarked
that they were mostly of his sex, and remembered that she
had told him how her friendships with women were few.
</p>

<p>
"Every Dick, Tom, and Harry on the country side is to
know about it seemingly," he said with a comical expression.
"I hope they'll take the hint anyhow, and the less we see
of 'em the better henceforward."
</p>

<p>
Then it was that she astonished him again, and the
humorous note was changed abruptly in his mind, though
not in hers.
</p>

<p>
"You men&mdash;so greedy you be&mdash;like a dog with a bone.
'Tis all or none with you."
</p>

<p>
He stared.  It sounded an unmaidenly speech to his ear.
</p>

<p>
"By God!  I should think so!  All or none indeed.  We
don't share sweethearts, I believe."
</p>

<p>
She enjoyed his tragical face.
</p>

<p>
"'Twould be a poor look out for them as tried to come
between me an' my gert monster," she said.
</p>

<p>
"It would be."
</p>

<p>
"An' for me too, I reckon?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he admitted.  "But don't be telling such
nonsense&mdash;or thinking such folly.  You've done with all men
but me for evermore.  The Lord help any man or woman
who ever came between us in deed or thought, if I catched
word of it."
</p>

<p>
She nodded.
</p>

<p>
"They'd be dust afore your wrath."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Friend left them presently and went to a little room
on the ground floor of Dunnagoat cot, where he pursued his
business of testing peat for tar and gas.  He never wearied
of this occupation.  Then, while Sarah Jane washed up the
tea things, Brendon made an excuse to leave her and spoke
with his future father-in-law.
</p>

<p>
"Can 'e lend me a razor, master?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"A razor?  Yes.  I don't use 'em of late years, but it
happens I've got one.  What for?  Have you changed your
mind and want to cut your throat for being a fool?"
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed.  I've only just begun to live; but she don't
like my whiskers."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Take 'em off, and she'll want 'e to grow 'em
again in a week.  Wear a hard hat and she'll order a billycock;
put on black gaiters and she'll cry out for yellow.
God help you, poor giant of a man!  You'll hear more
about yourself from her fearless lips in the next fortnight,
than ever you've found out yet all your life."
</p>

<p>
"The razor be&mdash;where?"
</p>

<p>
"Up in my sleeping chamber, in a little drawer under
the looking-glass."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you very much, master."
</p>

<p>
"They'm like the false gods o' the Bible: they think
nought of axing the men to gash themselves with knives.
The biggest fool of a woman as ever cumbered earth can
always be clever at inventing tortures for the men."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis all very well; but if I take Sarah Jane, you'll
have to marry again yourself, Mr. Friend," said Daniel.
</p>

<p>
"Not me.  I had one good one.  I drew a prize, though
she was always wrong about Amicombe Hill.  Ban't in
reason to expect two prizes."
</p>

<p>
Presently Daniel appeared with shaven cheeks before
Sarah Jane.  He left her to discover the loss, and she did
so in an instant.
</p>

<p>
"My stars! if it isn't as though you was another man!"
she said.  "But I wasn't <i>quite</i> tired of them all the same.
I think I must ax 'e to put on a beard, Dan.  I like 'em,
because faither's got one."
</p>

<p>
"I could easy enough; my chin be like a stubble field
after I've let him bide a day or two."
</p>

<p>
"But I couldn't rub my cheek against it while 'twas
coming!'
</p>

<p>
"Better let me go as I am."
</p>

<p>
"I'll think about that.  Be you going to stop to supper?"
</p>

<p>
"Can't, worse luck.  I've promised to be back for a few
indoor jobs this evening."
</p>

<p>
"When shall I see you next?"
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow night without a doubt.  I'll come up over
for an hour after supper."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a terrible long way up; an' a terrible rough road."
</p>

<p>
"Not to me&mdash;and never has been."
</p>

<p>
"I love you with every drop of blood in my body, you
dear blessed Daniel!"
</p>

<p>
"Well I know it; but 'tis such an amazing thought, I
can't grasp it yet.  'Twill take days, I doubt."
</p>

<p>
"I've grasped it tight enough!  'Tis the only thing in
my head.  I've forgot everything else in the world, for
there's nought else worth knowing, except you love me."
</p>

<p>
Thus they prattled at the door.  Then a great gust dashed
in and blew out the lamp.  Brendon had to stop until it was
relighted, and they made three more partings.  Then
Mr. Friend's voice called Sarah Jane, and Brendon set out in
earnest for home.
</p>

<p>
The darkness was full of storm; but his heart made a
heaven of night, and the elements that swooped, and
shouted, and soaked, were agreeable to Daniel as he plunged
into them.  They seemed tremendous as his love; and his
love made him tremendous as they were.  He felt kinship
with the lash of the rain and the thrust of the wind.
Underfoot, earth, like a slave, submitted to the torrent and the
gale; and he also spurned it even as they did; he feared
not its steep and stony miles; he swept forward as strong
and fierce as the sky, as joyful as the fetterless forces of
the air.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br><br>
SUSAN BRINGS THE NEWS
</h3>

<p>
On the morning after Daniel's glorious adventure, the
girl Susan found it necessary to withdraw from her Aunt
Hepsy's unsettled atmosphere and seek the calmer climate
of her Aunt Tab.  As usual, she appeared about breakfast
time on a washing day; and as usual Tabitha expressed
much concern and regret.  Susan enjoyed a good breakfast,
and found herself able to take an important part in the
subject of the moment.  To those who are familiar with the
rustic's sense of humour, it need not be said that the event
of that morning was Daniel Brendon's appearance whiskerless.
Over night they had not seen him, for a hunger, higher
than need of meat or drink, filled the man after his walk
with the storm.  He had desired no human face to come
between him and his thoughts, had done his work by
lantern-light in an outhouse, and had then gone to his
chamber and there communed with his God.  Kneeling, he
poured out immense gratitude and thanksgiving; and before
the first narrow light of day called him to rise, Brendon had
wakened and again devoutly turned his thoughts to the
creed that controlled him.
</p>

<p>
His advent at the breakfast table provoked titters, then
guffaws, then questions.  Agg first marked the change and
thrust his elbow into Joe Tapson's ribs; then Tabitha
cocked her thin nose, and John Prout smiled calmly.  It
was Lethbridge who first dared to approach the subject
directly.  After Walter Agg had stroked his own cheeks and
Tapson subtly inquired what was the price of hair for
stuffing pillow-cases, Peter Lethbridge boldly spoke and
reminded Dan of a circumstance that he had forgotten.  Upon
his abstraction at breakfast fell a startling utterance.
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord, Dan!" cried Lethbridge with great affected
concern, "the wind have blowed off your whiskers, my
bold hero!"
</p>

<p>
Then laughter echoed, so that the lamp shook and
Mr. Prout ordered silence.
</p>

<p>
"You'll wake master!" he said.  "Can't a man shave
his hair as it pleases him, without you zanies making that
row?"
</p>

<p>
"You'm a hardened bachelor, John," said Tapson; "but
I know better&mdash;eh, Dan'l?  Ban't what pleases you, but
what pleases her&mdash;come now?"
</p>

<p>
"If she'd axed un to shave his head, the poor soul would
have done it&mdash;wouldn't you, Dan?" asked Agg.
</p>

<p>
"I'd forgot 'em," confessed Brendon.  "I dare say it
looks odd to your silly eyes."
</p>

<p>
"Did she cut 'em off with her scissors?" inquired Lethbridge,
and Tabitha, taking Daniel's side, felt it necessary
to reprove him.
</p>

<p>
"You eat your bacon and don't be too funny, Peter
Lethbridge," she said, "else you might hurt yourself."
</p>

<p>
Brendon's love affair was well known and had already
formed matter for mirth.
</p>

<p>
"You've done wrong, however," declared Tapson.
"When Sarah Jane sees that great jowl of thine laid naked
as a pig's chap, she'll wish the whiskers back."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis like as if you got two triangles of white paint upon
your cheeks, Mr. Brendon," ventured Susan respectfully.
</p>

<p>
"You'm a lost man, mark me," continued Joe Tapson.
"'Twas a rash act, and you'll rue it yet."
</p>

<p>
"If you buzzing beetles will let me speak," answered
Dan genially, "I'd give 'e a bit of news.  There's such a
lot on my mind this morning, that I'd quite forgot my
whiskers.  Well, souls, she'm going to take me, thank
God!  I axed the question last afternoon and she be of the
same mind!"
</p>

<p>
The woman in Tabitha fluttered to her lips and head.
She went over and shook Brendon's hand, and her eyes
became a little moist.
</p>

<p>
"Bravo!  Bravo!" said Mr. Prout.  "Very glad, I'm
sure, though 'tis a shattering thing for a Ruddyford man to
want a wife."
</p>

<p>
"Now he's set the example, these here chaps will be
after the maidens, like terriers after rats; you mark me,"
foretold Joe Tapson.
</p>

<p>
"Tab," said John Prout, "draw off a quart or so of
beer&mdash;not cider.  'Tis early, but the thing warrants it.
Us'll drink good luck to 'em, an' long life an' a happy
fortune."
</p>

<p>
Dawn already weakened the light of the lamp and made
a medley of blue streaks and splashes on the men's faces.
Now they neglected their mugs of tea for the more popular
beverage, and all drank Daniel's health; while he grinned
to his ears and thanked them and shook hands with them.
</p>

<p>
It was then, when the party had decreased, and Tapson,
Agg, and Lethbridge were gone to work, that Susan spoke
with the frankness of youth.
</p>

<p>
"I'm awful surprised, Mr. Brendon," she said, "because
to home, where I live, 'tis thought that Jarratt Weekes, my
aunt's son, be going to marry Sarah Jane Friend.  He
thinks so hisself, for that matter."
</p>

<p>
"He thinks wrong, Susan," answered Daniel.  "He
offered marriage, but it wasn't to be.  Sarah Jane likes me
best, though I'm only a poor man.  And there's an end of
the matter."
</p>

<p>
"Of course she likes you best&mdash;such a whopper as you
be!  But my cousin, Jarratt, will be awful vexed about it,
when he hears."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry for him, I'm sure."
</p>

<p>
Susan fell into thought, from which her aunt aroused
her.
</p>

<p>
"Now, my dear, you can just put on your bonnet and
cloak and march home again.  I don't want you to-day.
Washing was done yesterday, and I've got to go down to
Bridgetstowe; so the sooner you run back to Aunt Hepsy
and beg her pardon, the better for you."
</p>

<p>
"Agg's going to take the cart to Gimmet Hill, and he
can drive you a good part of the way," said Mr. Prout.
</p>

<p>
Susan would have disputed this swift return under
ordinary circumstances; but to-day, the richer by great
news, she felt rather disposed to go back at once.  She did
not like Jarratt Weekes; for when, as sometimes happened,
he was busy and she had to show visitors over Lydford
Castle, he always took every penny of the money from her,
even though it exceeded the regulation charge.
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Susan.  "I'll go along with Mr. Agg;
and next time Jar has anything sharp to say to me,
I'll give him a stinger!"
</p>

<p>
"You'll do better to mind your own business," advised
her aunt.  "The man will hear he's out of luck soon
enough, without you telling him."
</p>

<p>
"Then I should lose the sight of his face," said Susan
spitefully.  "Him and his mother be so cock-sure that
she's going to take him."
</p>

<p>
"A good few others besides Jarratt Weekes will have to
face it," said Tabitha.  "There's been a lot after that lovely
she for years.  They flaxen maidens make the men so silly
as sheep.  You won't have 'em running after you in a
string, Susan, though you grow up never so comely."
</p>

<p>
"I ban't so sartain of that," said Susan.  "I know a
chap or two&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She broke off and picked up her sunbonnet.
</p>

<p>
"You ban't so bad for fifteen, sure enough," declared
John Prout.  "Now then, off you go, or else Walter will
be away without 'e."
</p>

<p>
The girl, who had left Lydford at half-past four in the
morning, now returned quite cheerfully.  As Agg's cart
breasted White Hill and presently reached the high road,
the sun came out and the weather promised a little peace.
It was bright and still after the storm.  Some belated
Michaelmas daisies yet blossomed in the garden of Philip
Weekes; a cat sat at the door in the sun.  It recognized
Susan and greeted her as she returned.  In the rear of the
house, clearly to be heard, her aunt's voice sounded shrill.
She was talking to a neighbour, and Susan listened, but
heard no good of herself.
</p>

<p>
"The anointed, brazen, shameless trollop&mdash;the hussy! the
minx!  And to think what I've done and suffered for
her!  The dogs and beasts have more heart in 'em than
her.  Here be I&mdash;toiling day and night to make her a useful
creature and teach her the way to grow up decent&mdash;and
she turns on me, like the little wasp she is, and runs away,
as if I was the plague.  Let it happen once more&mdash;but once&mdash;an'
so sure as the sun's in the sky, she shall go to the
workhouse.  'Tis the evil blood in her veins&mdash;the toad.
Her mother&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Here Susan intervened.
</p>

<p>
"You can call me what you please, Aunt Hepsy," she
said.  "But don't you go giving my dead mother no names.
I wasn't her fault anyway."
</p>

<p>
"Back again, you saucy maggot!  No&mdash;poor soul, you
wasn't her fault; you was her eternal misfortune&mdash;same as
you be mine.  But don't you think I'm an angel, because
I ban't&mdash;nothing but an unfortunate, down-trodden old
woman.  But I won't be rode roughshod over by a black
imp like you, and so I tell 'e.  You go once again, and
God's my judge, you shan't come back.  I won't let your
shadow over my doorstep no more.  You shan't bring my
grey hairs with sorrow to the grave, you scourge of a girl!"
</p>

<p>
She rated, like some harsh-voiced machine that needs oil,
and Susan, perfectly accustomed to these explosions, stood
silent before her, waiting for a familiar hitch or gasp, that she
knew would presently reduce her aunt to temporary silence.
</p>

<p>
At last it came, just as Philip Weekes appeared from a
visit to his poultry.
</p>

<p>
"This be very serious, Susan," he said.  "I really don't
know what to think of it.  'Tis a senseless, improper thing
to be off like this whenever you be niffed with your
aunt&mdash;such a woman as she is, too.  And&mdash;and&mdash;how is it you'm
back so soon?"
</p>

<p>
"Because&mdash;&mdash;" began Susan; but Mrs. Weekes was now
able to proceed.
</p>

<p>
"Because your Aunt Tabitha didn't just happen to want
'e, no doubt.  As feeble as a mole she is, to have stood it
so often.  She did ought to have sent you packing with a
flea in your ear first time ever you dared to run away,
instead of keeping you to help washing.  Just like you
all&mdash;you Prouts and Weekeses&mdash;soft stuff&mdash;soft stuff&mdash;and
you'll all go down into the pit together.  Lord, He knows
where you'd be yourself, Philip Weekes, if it wasn't for me.
But even I can't turn putty into starch.  Putty you are,
and putty you will be till the Day of Doom."
</p>

<p>
"I comed back, Uncle Philip, because I got hold of a
very interesting piece o' news, and I knowed Aunt Hepsy
would be very much obliged to me for telling of it," said
Susan swiftly.
</p>

<p>
"Interesting news, indeed!  Then you've been listening
to other people, I suppose?  That's your way.  If you'd
listen to me, you might get salvation; but never, never&mdash;what
I say don't matter more than the wind in the hedge.
I'm only an old fool that haven't seen the world, and haven't
got no wisdom or learning.  Of course Aunt Tabitha knows
so much better, and of course Uncle John's a good second
to Solomon!  Well, well, there's times when a broken
spirit hungers for the grave and peace.  And so I feel more
and more when I look at you, Susan."
</p>

<p>
"All the same, I comed home for nought but to tell you.
'Tis about Sarah Jane.  She'm not going to have cousin
Jar.  She's took another man.  I've seen him."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Weekes sat down.  She dropped so suddenly that
her husband was alarmed.  Her hand went up to her breast;
her eyes grew round.
</p>

<p>
"Take her away," said Hephzibah feebly; "take that
little black-eyed liar away, and get me my peppermint.  'Tis
her one delight and plot from daylight till dark to fetch up
my spasms; and now she've done it."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis solemn truth; and I don't want to fetch up your
spasms, Gods knows," whimpered Susan.  "The man himself
told me.  He's called Daniel Brendon&mdash;a whacker with
gert hands, I never see the like.  He's shaved off his
whiskers for her, and she's taken him.  So Jar's out of it."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Weekes brought his wife her peppermint mixture,
and it appeared to have a remarkable effect.
</p>

<p>
"Out of it!  We'll see about that.  To throw over
Jarratt Weekes for a nameless clod-pole from the middle of
the Moor!  You just go down to the castle this instant
moment and fetch the man to me.  The sooner he hears tell
of this, the better."
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't do it," advised Jarratt's father.  "Let her
tell him.  The blow will fall easier like that.  'Twill cut
him up rather cruel."
</p>

<p>
"Bah!" cried Mrs. Weekes, rising to her feet.  "I'd
sooner go to a shell-snail for opinions than you.  A mouse
have got more courage, and a ear-wig more sense.  He shall
hear, and he shall go to this chap and just bid him be off
about his business.  Why&mdash;good angels!&mdash;ban't Jarratt and
Sarah Jane almost tokened already?  Be my son going to
give her up now?  Not very likely!  He's got my courage
in his blood, I hope.  A fighter I've always been, and always
had to be; and I thank God for it every night on my knees.
And so should you, you gawkim of a man, for you'd be of
no more account than an eft in a pond if it wasn't for
me."
</p>

<p>
Philip nodded mechanically, as he always did when the
torrent roared; then he faded away to his fowls, and Susan
went off that she might find her cousin.  This task was
agreeable to her, for she did not love him.  She conveyed
her news in as few words as possible, and he stared at her
without any words at all.  Then presently, with a dark
brow, the man came before his mother.
</p>

<p>
"What's this?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"You go and take off them filthy boots and sweep the
upper landing," said Aunt Hepsy to Susan, who appeared
a few yards behind her son; then, when a broom began to
work overhead, she turned to Jarratt.
</p>

<p>
"Well may you ask!  That thankless terror of a child
runned off to Ruddyford again last night; and there she
heard it.  The man be called Daniel Brendon&mdash;some labourer
lately took on by Woodrow.  But 'tis for you to stop it if
you're my son.  I lay I'd put a spoke in their wheel double
quick!  All the same, the woman's not worth it&mdash;a gert,
good-for-nought, gallivanting giglet as she is!"
</p>

<p>
"A pretty poor compliment to me, if it's true," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Very likely it isn't true at all.  Still, it's your job.
Only think twice.  There's the schoolmaster's darter be
worth twenty of Sarah Jane."
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't stand her voice, mother&mdash;nor yet her temper."
</p>

<p>
"More fool you.  Give me a voice and a temper, too,
if you want to get on in the world.  'Tis the gentle sort, as
twitters like birds and be frightened to hurt a fly, as always
go down.  Let people hear your voice and feel your temper;
then they'll respect you and you'll keep up your end of the
stick.  Them as be so sweet as sugar, mostly melt like
sugar in the hard business of life."
</p>

<p>
"One thing I know, afore God, and that is, if she takes
any man but me, I'll be revenged on her and him, if it costs
my last farthing."
</p>

<p>
"What's the sense of that talk?  If you'm set on her
still, have her willy-nilly.  Do anything inside honesty.
Ride off with her!  Break the man's stupid head for him!
All the same, that's not sense, but only passion.  My advice
may be nought; but it is just this: that you bide along with
your mother for the present, and wait for a better maiden
to turn up."
</p>

<p>
"That woman could have done pretty well anything she
liked with me."
</p>

<p>
"I hope not.  What foolishness!  You think so now.
You wouldn't have thought so a week beyond your honey-month.
Well, 'tis for you to go forward.  The very sort
of job I should have liked, if I'd been a man."
</p>

<p>
"I'll have it out with the chap."
</p>

<p>
"Better have it out with her.  And yet, perhaps, you'm
right.  Tell him to his face she'm yours, and tokened to
'e.  Stir him up; or, if you find he's that sort, pay him
off.  Twenty pounds would go an awful long way with a
man.  'Tis far easier for such a chap to get a girl to walk
with him than put by twenty pounds into the saving's bank."
</p>

<p>
"A likely idea," said Jarratt.  "Such a fellow wouldn't
know what love means, same as an educated man like me.
I dare say if I was to put it into pounds, shillings, and
pence, he'd meet me like a lamb."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Weekes almost regretted giving her son advice that
looked so promising.  Now, she did not wish him to marry
Sarah Jane; she did not wish him to marry at all; but
since he seemed set upon the step, her desire turned to the
schoolmaster's daughter as a woman of character, who
would also have three figures for her dowry.
</p>

<p>
"When all's said, I could wish you would think of Mary."
</p>

<p>
"Not I," answered her son.  "I saw a touch of Mary
after that committee meeting at her father's.  The place was
pretty full of baccy smoke and beer reek, certainly; and
she didn't say nothing&mdash;not a word&mdash;when she looked in at
the finish; but there was an expression on her face that
made me almost sorry for Churchward after we'd gone,
though he is the biggest, emptiest old fool in Lydford."
</p>

<p>
"A silly, blown-up man!  I like to stab his ideas with
a word, and let the wind out.  But his daughter's not so
chuckle-headed.  She'd make a tidy wife."
</p>

<p>
"Not for me.  I'll fight yet for Sarah Jane.  And any
stick's good enough to beat a dog."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Weekes, however, hesitated before this sentiment.
</p>

<p>
"Fight fair, Jar," she said.  "Don't let it be told of
my son that he didn't go to work honest and above-board.
No&mdash;no, I never would believe it.  Mrs. Swain often says
to me that whatever faults I may have&mdash;and who hasn't?&mdash;yet
I speak home to the truth, good market or bad, and
never deceive the youngest child as comes with a penny,
or the simplest fool who would buy a fowl without feeling
it.  Be straight.  You must be straight, for there's not a
crooked drop of blood in your veins.  You know all about
your mother's family, and as for your father's&mdash;rag of a
man though he is&mdash;I will say of Philip Weekes that he
never departs from uprightness by a hair.  Often, in my
most spirited moments, when I've poured the bitter truth
into his ear, like a river, half the night long, your father
have agreed to every word, and thanked me for throwing
such light on his character."
</p>

<p>
"I shan't offer the man twenty to begin with," he said.
"I may choke him off for less.  I ban't angry with him:
I'm angry with her for listening to him, or allowing herself
to know such trash."
</p>

<p>
"And I'll help where I get the chance, be sure of that.
Your good's my good.  If I can catch Sarah Jane some day,
I'll drop a word in season."
</p>

<p>
"Don't," he said.  "You keep out of it till I tell you.
I'll ax you soon enough to lend a hand if the time comes
when you can be useful."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br><br>
THE PRICE OF SARAH JANE
</h3>

<p>
The air was heavy with unshed rain, and the Moor reeked
after past storms of night, as Jarratt rode over Lyd river
and breasted the slopes of Bra Tor.  A boy on a pony
followed him, and two dogs brought up the rear.  Mr. Weekes
was come to drive some colts off their pastures;
and, being doubtful, to a few miles, where they might be
found, he had made an early start.  Great clouds hid the
summits of the land, and water shone in pools or fell in
rivulets on every side.
</p>

<p>
Then it was that, passing through the mediæval ruins of
old enterprise, where once Elizabethan miners streamed the
Moor for tin, the keeper of Lydford Castle suddenly found
himself face to face with a man much in his thoughts of
late.  Though he had never seen Brendon until that hour,
he recognized him instantly by reason of his great size.
Daniel was walking up the hill with his face towards the
peat-works, and he carried a message from Mr. Woodrow
to Gregory Friend.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning!" shouted Jarratt, and the pedestrian
stopped.  Soon Weekes was beside him and had leisure
to note his rival.  The great brown face, square jaw,
dog-like eyes and immense physical strength of the man were
all noted in a searching glance; and he also saw what
pleased him little: that Brendon was better dressed,
cleaner, and smarter every way than a common hind.
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen my colts this way, neighbour?" he
asked.  "They're ear-marked with red worsted."
</p>

<p>
"Then I met with them only yesterday.  There's a grey
mare in foal along with them."
</p>

<p>
"That's right."
</p>

<p>
"You'll find 'em down in the strolls on this side
Rattle-brook for certain."
</p>

<p>
"Much obliged to you."
</p>

<p>
Weekes shouted to his boy, directed the road, and told
him to proceed and wait by the river until he himself should
follow.  Then he turned again to Brendon.
</p>

<p>
"You're not a Lydford man, are you?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  I belong to Ruddyford&mdash;down-along.  I'm just
going up to the peat-works with a message.  You'll be
Mr. Jarratt Weekes, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Jarratt Weekes is my name.  And what's yours?"
</p>

<p>
"Daniel Brendon."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! you're not easily forgot.  I suppose you don't
know of anybody who wants a horse?  This one I'm riding
is for sale."
</p>

<p>
Brendon found Mr. Weekes walking slowly up the hill
beside him.  His pulse quickened.  He guessed that the
other meant to speak of matters more personal presently,
for it had come to his ears that Jarratt Weekes publicly
refused to give up Sarah Jane.  Agg brought news from
Lydford how Weekes had said in the bar of the Castle Inn
that he was engaged to Gregory Friend's daughter, and
would punish any man who denied it.
</p>

<p>
"A good horse seemingly.  Have 'e asked my master,
Mr. Woodrow?  He's only waiting to be tempted, I believe."
</p>

<p>
"A good horse, as you say; but he won't carry beer,"
explained Jarratt Weekes.  "Not that I ever want him to
do so; but he's always nervous of the dark.  Old farmer
Routleigh used to have him; then, coming home market-merry
from Okehampton, he got into trouble and was left
in the hedge.  I like the horse very well, but he's barely up
to my weight.  He'd suit Woodrow exactly, I should judge."
</p>

<p>
"I'll mention the matter to him."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Brendon.  Brendon was it you said, or Brandon?"
</p>

<p>
"Brendon's my name."
</p>

<p>
"Lucky I met you, then, for I've wanted to have a say
with you for some time."
</p>

<p>
Daniel did not answer.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, now&mdash;between men there need be no beating
about the bush.  That's women's way.  And a woman I
want to talk about.  In Lydford they are mentioning the
name of a Daniel Brendon with that of Miss Friend, who
lives up here for the present at Dunnagoat Cottage with her
father."
</p>

<p>
The other's face hardened, and a heavy look came into
his eyes; but he did not speak.
</p>

<p>
"That's not as it should be," continued Jarratt Weekes.
"It gets about, and then there's wrong ideas in the air.
Living up here, the girl can't hear it or contradict it.  But
'tis a very unmaidenly thing for her to be talked over like
that, and, frankly, I don't much like it, Brendon."
</p>

<p>
Still Daniel preserved silence.  His heart was beating
hard; he felt anger running in his veins and his jaws
fastening on each other.  But he made no answer.  Instead he
stopped, slowly drew his pipe and a tobacco-pouch from his
pocket, and prepared to smoke.
</p>

<p>
"Buckets more rain be coming," he said presently, looking
at the sky.
</p>

<p>
"Don't change the subject, please.  Answer my question."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know you'd asked one."
</p>

<p>
"You're wasting time to pretend ignorance.  Say what
you've got to say.  I've a perfect reason and right to speak
to you on this delicate matter, and everybody well knows
it&mdash;but yourself apparently.  Now speak."
</p>

<p>
"You had better finish telling first," answered Daniel.
</p>

<p>
"To me you appear to be on a wild goose chase altogether,
and talking no better than silly rummage.  Why are you
so busy about Sarah Jane Friend?  Tell me that, and then
'twill be time for me to talk to you.  Let's have your reason
and right you mention, if you please, Mr. Weekes."
</p>

<p>
"My reason and right is that I am going to marry her
myself.  We are engaged.  Everybody knows that very
well.  And nobody better than Sarah Jane Friend.  It
happens that I've been exceedingly busy lately&mdash;too busy to
be quite so lover-like as I ought.  So she's been amusing
herself by drawing you on.  But 'tis beyond a joke now,
and I'll have no more of it, or I'll speak to your master."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said the other, "that's the sort of man you are,
then?  My girl was wise to throw you over, and your dirty
money too.  Tokened to you, you liar!  I wonder the hand
of God don't drive you into the dust for saying it!  Tokened
to you&mdash;when you know so well as I do that, last Sunday
week, she told you, once for all, she wasn't going to take
you?  What d'you think me and she are?  A pair of fools
to go down afore your brazen voice?"
</p>

<p>
"You'd better not have me for an enemy, my man.
It won't pay you in the long run, I promise you."
</p>

<p>
"Bluster's a fine weapon&mdash;to back a lie; but truth can
stand without it.  You've told me a string of lies, and
well you knew they were."
</p>

<p>
He lighted his pipe, and Weekes laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, you're a smart man, I find.  I'll give you
that credit.  You see pretty far through a millstone&mdash;eh?
If you won't knock under to me, then we'll start again, and
put it on a business footing.  I want no misunderstanding
with you.  This girl thinks she's fond of you for the
moment.  I'll grant that much.  But you'll see, if you
really care a button about her, that her prosperity would be
a good deal surer with me than with you.  You needn't be
angry at all.  This is a matter of business.  I want her.
I've known her&mdash;long, long before ever you did; and if you
hadn't turned up from God knows where, she'd have come
to me right and proper when I decided I was ready for
her.  I am ready for her now.  If I'd asked her a month
sooner, she'd have come without question, of course; but
meanwhile she had seen you, and was taken, like a child,
with your size.  So it stands.  I grant that you've got the
whip hand for the minute.  You have me in your power up
to any reasonable sum.  It lies in a nutshell, Daniel
Brendon.  What's your figure?"
</p>

<p>
"For chucking her?"
</p>

<p>
"For leaving her alone to come to her senses.  Money's
not got every day; a wife can be.  If you want the last,
there's no better way to get 'em than with the first."
</p>

<p>
"Yet Sarah Jane put me afore your cash seemingly?"
</p>

<p>
"Like any foolish girl might in a rash moment.  But
you're not a fool, or I'm no judge of character.  You're a
man of ideas and ambitions.  I thought you were a common
labourer.  That's what made me rather savage.  I see
you're a man as good as myself&mdash;every bit.  So I'll forgive
Sarah that much, and appeal to your sense of justice to
give me back my own.  And since I know well enough
you will be making a great sacrifice, I offer you an
equivalent."
</p>

<p>
Daniel listened.
</p>

<p>
"A generous chap you are, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I am.  I don't want to exert force, or trust to my
position.  I meet you man to man equal.  I've long been
as good as tokened to her, and it would be a very wicked
thing for you to come between us.  I'll not say you have
no rights, however; I'll not say that a silly woman's passing
whim isn't to count.  I'll grant everything&mdash;everything
in reason.  I'll allow that you won her fair and square,
though she didn't tell you quite the truth, I'm afraid.
I'll allow that for the moment she honestly thinks that
she loves you better than she loves me.  But, beyond all
that, there's these two points.  I'll offer you good money
to drop this, as in justice to me you should do at once; and
I'll  say that if you want Sarah Jane to be happy and content
and prosperous, you must see that I'm the man to make
her so&mdash;not you."
</p>

<p>
"That's your side, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; that's my side&mdash;the side of justice and wisdom, if
you come to think of it."
</p>

<p>
"And what's the figure?  I'm a poor man, and oughtn't
to lose a chance of making good money, Mr. Weekes.  'Tis
the opportunity of a lifetime, you see.  'Twill never come
again."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm no skinflint.  Give her up and I'll let you
have ten pounds."
</p>

<p>
"Ten pounds!  That's an awful lot!"
</p>

<p>
"A lot of money, as you say."
</p>

<p>
"But not enough for Sarah Jane."
</p>

<p>
Weekes held the battle as good as won, and now determined
to fight for the lowest figure possible.  He was rather
astonished to succeed so easily, and from great anxiety leapt
quickly over to the other extreme of contempt.
</p>

<p>
"You're greedy, I'm afraid."
</p>

<p>
"No, no&mdash;not greedy, only businesslike.  I won her
fairly, you see.  Us can't all go uphill, like you.  Some
stands still; some goes down.  Here's my chance to go
up a little."
</p>

<p>
"I'll make it fifteen, then."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis for me to make the figure now, and for you to
pay it.  I suppose the question is what's Sarah Jane Friend
worth to you?"
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," answered Jarratt.  "That's neither here
nor there.  All I want to know is what money you'll drop
her for.  And I warn you not to be too greedy, else I may
get rusty on my side and take her by force for nothing."
</p>

<p>
"I see; I must be reasonable?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course&mdash;give and take in business."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, suppose we say&mdash;a hundred million
pounds?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't be a fool," answered the other testily.  "I'm
not talking to you for fun."
</p>

<p>
Then Daniel's temper burst from control.
</p>

<p>
"God damn you, you ugly, cross-eyed cur!  To dare to
come to a man and offer ten pounds to him for his woman!
You flint-faced wretch!&mdash;a withered thing like you to think
of her!  I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You'd better&mdash;&mdash;" began Weekes; but Brendon roared
him down.
</p>

<p>
"Shut your mouth!  'Tis your turn now to hear me!
If you dare to speak again, I'll pull you off your horse and
take the skin from your bones!  What dirt d'you think I'm
made of, to tell this wickedness in my ears?  I wonder you
ban't struck for it.  Ten pounds for Sarah Jane; and you
sit there on your horse under Heaven and nothing done
against you!  But it won't be forgot&mdash;remember that.
'Tis a black mark upon your name for evermore.  Ten
pounds; and you ought to be damned ten times over for
every shilling of it!  And if ever you come anigh her again,
I'll break your neck, God's my judge!  A man as she's said
'No' to a dozen times!  Go and hang yourself, you grey
rat!  She wouldn't have you if you was made of gold, and
well you know it.  To say as I came between you!  To
say she'd be a happier woman along with you than with me!
Happy with you&mdash;as reckon she'm worth ten pounds!
There&mdash;get away after your ponies, and never you look
into her face or mine again, or I'll knock your two eyes
into one&mdash;so now you know!"
</p>

<p>
He strode on up the hill, panting and raging like a bull,
while Weekes looked after him.  Jarratt had turned very
grey under this torrent of abuse.  He was stung by the
other's scorn, and felt that he did not deserve it.  But he
kept his wits, and perceived that Brendon, huge and loutish
though he might be, had proved too clever for him in this
matter.  The lover of Sarah Jane had trapped Mr. Weekes
by a pretended greed, and led him into folly.  He realized
that probably the world in general, and Sarah Jane in
particular, would presently hear that he had offered a
ten-pound note for her; and then raised the figure reluctantly
to fifteen.  This was not likely to advance his reputation
at Lydford, or elsewhere.  He even imagined the schoolboys
shouting vulgar remarks after him along the public way.
</p>

<p>
Now he sat still on his horse for full five minutes.  Then
he rode after Brendon and overtook him.
</p>

<p>
"Only one word," he said.  "Forget this.  I didn't
understand you.  I'll interfere with you no more.  You
were right, and I was wrong.  As you are victorious, be
generous.  Don't let my folly go further.  We all make
mistakes.  I have erred, Mr. Brendon, and I regret it."
</p>

<p>
Brendon regarded Jarratt doubtfully.  The giant still
panted with his anger, and steam rolled out from his mouth
in puffs upon the wet, dark air.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis human to err; 'tis human to forgive.  I was
wrong&mdash;very wrong.  I own it.  Who can do more?  We've
all got our weak places, and money is mine.  Let them
without sin cast the first stone.  Remember what I must
feel to lose Sarah Jane."
</p>

<p>
This last stroke answered its purpose, and Brendon
relented very slowly.
</p>

<p>
"I know well enough what that must be."
</p>

<p>
"Be generous then to a desperate man.  Hide up this
that I have told you.  The sum is nothing.  I knew well
enough you wouldn't take ten&mdash;or ten thousand.  In sober
honesty I'm much poorer than folk think, though I pretend
to be warm.  Anyway, I ask you to pardon me for insulting
you, and to keep this talk secret&mdash;even from her.  No man
likes his mistakes blazed out for the people to scoff at.  Do
as you'd be done by in this&mdash;that's all I ask."
</p>

<p>
He pleaded better than he knew, for the victor already
regretted his own coarse language.
</p>

<p>
"Let it be, then," answered Brendon.  "Go your way,
and I'll go mine; and not a word of this will pass my
lips.  We was both wrong&mdash;you to think of such a vile thing,
and me to curse you.  'Twas all fair, and you had first
say to her; but she likes me best, so there's no more to
be said."
</p>

<p>
"I'll abide by that," answered Jarratt Weekes.  Then
he turned his horse's head and rode away, with Care behind
him, and such a load of hatred in his heart that it seemed
to poison his blood and choke him physically.  He gasped,
and the evil words of Daniel Brendon&mdash;uttered with
passion&mdash;were as thistledown to the thoughts that now bred within
the brain of his enemy.  A violent lust for revenge grew
up in the soul of Jarratt Weekes from that hour; but
Brendon, for his part, quickly repented of the things that
he had said; displayed a victor's magnanimity; felt something
of the other's tragic and eternal loss; and found it
in his heart to sorrow for him.
</p>

<p>
Daniel also mourned for himself and his mighty lapse of
temper and self-control.  That night he prayed to be
pardoned; he trembled to consider where his sudden rages
might some day lead him; he thanked his Saviour for
unutterable blessings, and implored that a greater patience,
humility, and gentleness might be added to his character.
He called also upon Heaven to sustain Jarratt Weekes under
this shattering stroke, and begged that it might presently
be put in his power to do the disappointed man some
service.

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br><br>
FIRST BLOOD TO BRENDON
</h3>

<p>
In the struggle between Daniel Brendon and Jarratt
Weekes, circumstances combined to strengthen the former's
cause at every point.  Right, as a matter of fact, was on
his side, but what promised to be a greater source of
strength, he found in Sarah Jane.  The ingenuous and fearless
character of his betrothed and her intrepid handling
of truth, albeit embarrassing enough at times, made her
strong against enemies of the type of Jarratt Weekes.
Moreover, the lovers had many friends; the castle-keeper,
few.  His mother tried to help him; but she was honest
and her shifts proved absolutely futile.  She could only
suggest that Jarratt should see Sarah Jane and argue with
her the folly of such action.  She herself invited Gregory
Friend's daughter to tea, and used what powers of persuasion
she possessed to turn the girl.  She also saw Mr. Friend,
and showed him the advantages of a union with the Weekes
family.  Her attacks were direct and straightforward;
therefore they failed.  Neither did Jarratt's more tortuous
methods win him any advantage.  He worked what little
harm he could, but it amounted to nothing.  Daniel's record
was clean; he had a reputation for sober-mindedness; no
man could tax him with wrong-doing.  To separate him
from Sarah Jane at any cost became the castle-keeper's
problem; but, while achieving this deed, it was vital that
the woman's regard for Jarratt should be increased rather
than lessened; and the double task proved altogether beyond
Jarratt's power.
</p>

<p>
He trusted that Hilary Woodrow might prove an obstacle,
and that marriage must at least mean dismissal from
Ruddyford; but even here his hopes were disappointed.
Matters combined at the farm largely to advance Daniel
Brendon's ambition, and a tower of strength appeared in a
quarter from which little might have been hoped.  Tabitha
Prout smiled upon the match, first from kindness of heart,
secondly to gain private ends.  Another woman at Ruddyford
had long been her desire.  She sounded Brendon first,
then finding that he approved, approached her master.
The person most vitally involved in Tabitha's plot was her
own brother; but she knew that John would make no
difficulties, and therefore left him until the last.
</p>

<p>
"Does your maiden know anything about milk and
butter?" she asked Daniel, on an occasion when they were
alone.
</p>

<p>
"Can't say she does; but there's nothing she couldn't
learn in a few months&mdash;quick as light at learning she is,"
he answered.
</p>

<p>
Then Tabitha proposed that Sarah Jane on her marriage
should come to Ruddyford as dairymaid.
</p>

<p>
"As things go," she explained, "'tis all sixes and
sevens; and now the boy milks, and now Tapson do, and
there's no proper system to it.  But with our cows, few
though they be, a dairymaid ought to be kept; and she'd
help me here and there&mdash;I expect that.  And if she comes,
we ought to keep three more cows, if not four.  I only
want to know if you be willing.  'Tis worth your while,
for if that was planned, you could bide here after you're
married and wouldn't have to look round again."
</p>

<p>
"Too good to be true, Tabitha Prout; yet none the less
a great thought; and I lay you'd find Sarah Jane your
right hand if she did come.  But where could us bide?"
</p>

<p>
"That's easy enough.  The difficulty is with Mr. Woodrow.
However, I'll have a tell with him and put my grey
hairs and increasing age as strong as I can.  I'm overworked
without a doubt.  This place has suffered from lack
of females for years, and I won't have no more boys, so
I've got to do it all&mdash;save for the messy, silly help you
men give.  But there 'tis: with his hate of 'em, I doubt
if he'd stand a young woman about the place."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder.  Make a point of the extra cows, Tabitha.
That might win him; and as for Sarah Jane, by the time
we'm married, I'll promise for her that she knows the whole
craft of milk and cream and butter near so well as you do."
</p>

<p>
But Tabitha would not allow that.
</p>

<p>
"In time&mdash;in time.  She won't have my hand to butter
in six months, Daniel&mdash;perhaps not in six years.
Butter-making's born with a woman.  But I'll teach her so much
as she can learn.  Not that anybody ever taught me&mdash;save
nature and my own wits."
</p>

<p>
Joe Tapson entered at this moment, knew not of the
argument, but heard Tabitha's self-praise and sneered at
her.  They often wrangled hotly about the relative powers
of the sexes; for while Tapson was a cynic touching
womankind, Tabitha declared that she had seen too much
of men in her life to have any admiration left for them.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis about Sarah Jane and work," explained Miss Prout.
</p>

<p>
"Work?" he said.  "What about work?  Let her do
her proper married woman's work and get boys.&mdash;plenty of
'em&mdash;eh, Daniel?"
</p>

<p>
Tabitha sniffed scorn upon him.
</p>

<p>
"Always the way with you vainglorious creatures.
'For us to be mothers and get boys'&mdash;the conceit of it!
As if there was nothing else for a woman to do beside that!"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing&mdash;except get girls," said Joe bluntly.  "There's
nought else in the world that men can't do a darned sight
better than females.  Don't you deceive yourself there.
Why, look around&mdash;even to cooking and sewing; tailors and
men-cooks beat you out of the field, when first-class work
has to be done.  You work hard enough&mdash;too hard even in
your way; yet the likes of you&mdash;to say it in a perfectly
kindly spirit&mdash;don't really do much more than cumber the
earth.  Women be wanted for the next generation&mdash;not
for this one.  Their work lies there; and when you talk
about the value in the world of all you frost-bitten virgins,
I'm bound to tell you, without feeling, that 'tis only in
your own imagination."
</p>

<p>
"You speak like the withered stump of a married man
you are," she answered indignantly.  "I blush for you&mdash;you
to lecture me!  'Tis a good thing you've no finger
in the next generation, I'm sure; and I lay the happiest
moment in your wife's life was the last."
</p>

<p>
But Joe had not finished.  He smiled at her temper and
spoke again.
</p>

<p>
"Why, my dear soul, after the business of child-bearing's
done, you ban't so much use as cows; for they do give
us milk; but such as you yield nought but vinegar."
</p>

<p>
"What things to say!" exclaimed Daniel; "who ever
heard the like?"
</p>

<p>
"Truth's truth; and the sharp truth about women none
knows better than me.  But all the same&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Shut your mouth and get out of my kitchen," cried
Tabitha.  "What woman could be blamed for treating you
harsh?  To insult the whole of us&mdash;a poisonous, one-eyed
rat like you!"
</p>

<p>
"A one-eyed rat I may be," retorted Joe; "but I can
bite, and 'tis easy to see the force of my words by the heat
of your temper.  You hate men, and I hate women, so all's
said."
</p>

<p>
The question to be answered was Hilary Woodrow's
attitude towards the suggestion of Sarah Jane as dairymaid.
He had heard that Brendon was going to be married, and
supposed that the giant would leave Ruddyford upon that
event.  But he cared little whether Daniel went or stopped.
The problem of labour on a Dartmoor farm was far less
acute fifty years ago than at present, and the master knew
that Daniel's place might easily be filled.  He listened to
Tabitha's arguments but withheld judgment until he had
consulted his head man.  John Prout, however, approved,
and himself disposed of the only difficulty attaching to the
plan.
</p>

<p>
"I think very well of it," he said, "and to show how
well, I'll help by coming to live here, and letting Brendon
have my cottage.  That makes all clear.  She's a very
nice, strong maiden, and Tabitha's right when she says
we want another woman about the place.  There's too
much on her shoulders now.  You'll do well to let it be
so, master; and then the girl can set about learning her
work straight away and be useful from the start."
</p>

<p>
Thus the matter fell out, to Sarah Jane's delight; and
her father was also well pleased, because his daughter
would henceforth dwell close to him.  The woman asked
for no assistance or advice in the conduct of her life
henceforth.  Her object was swiftly to master the business of
the dairy, and to that end, after conversation with Tabitha
Prout, she went to Lydford and saw Mrs. Weekes.
Whether Hephzibah could be expected to serve her, Sarah
Jane never stopped to consider.  Nobody knew more about
the local dairy-farmers than the wife of Philip Weekes;
nobody therefore was better able to help Gregory Friend's
daughter, if she chose to do so.  But Hephzibah apparently
did not choose.
</p>

<p>
"To have the face to come to me!  'Tis enough to make
angels weep tears of blood, Sarah Jane," she said.  "You
throw over the best men in Lydford and go your own wild,
headlong way to misery; and let me waste torrents of
advice upon you; and then walk in, as if nothing was the
matter in the world, and ax me to get you a larner's place
along with cows!  What you'll come to, be hid with your
Maker, for no human can guess it.  Never was such a
saucy wench seen or heard of.  You'll be asking me for a
wedding present next, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
"Don't see no reason why not," said Sarah Jane.  "I
can't marry two men, I believe; and I love one and don't
care a rush for t'other, so there's an end to it.  Because
you wanted for me to take Jarratt and I ban't going
to&mdash;that's no reason why you shouldn't do me a kindness."
</p>

<p>
"Loramercy! you talk just like a man.  If you don't
carry a heart under your ribs, I do.  You wait till you've
got a proper son as hankers after a girl, and she won't
have him&mdash;then we'll see how 'tis.  Don't you never ax me
for the price of a shoe-lace to keep you from the union
workhouse, Sarah Jane, because you won't get it."
</p>

<p>
Sarah laughed pleasantly.
</p>

<p>
"For all you scream out at everybody, like a cat when
his tail's trod on, you're my sort, Mrs. Weekes.  You say
what you think&mdash;though you may think wrong as often
as anybody."
</p>

<p>
"You'm an outrageous baggage," said Hephzibah, "and
I won't bandy no more words with you.  Not a hand&mdash;not
a finger will I lift to help such a thankless fool of a woman.
Go to Mrs. Perkins at Little Lydford, and get out of
my sight, else I'll put my ten commandants on your
face!"
</p>

<p>
Thus, despite her ferocity and terrible threats,
Mrs. Weekes told Sarah Jane exactly what she wanted to know;
and Hephzibah knew that she had done so, and scorned
herself in secret for a silly fool.  But her nature could not
choose but like Sarah Jane.  In secret she loved all fearless
things.  Therefore, while hating the girl because she would
not take Jarratt, Mrs. Weekes had to admire her because
she was herself.
</p>

<p>
The work that Sarah Jane wanted was found for her,
and during the next three months she disappeared from
Amicombe Hill.  Sometimes on Sundays, however, she visited
her father.  She worked as hard as she possibly could,
proved an apt pupil, made new friends at her temporary
home in Lew Trenchard, and saw Daniel Brendon now and
then.  She also wrote to him and her father.
</p>

<p>
Meantime her betrothed planned his future, calculated
the cost of new furniture for Mr. Prout's cottage, and made
himself very useful to that large-hearted man.
</p>

<p>
John Prout was quite content to return to the farm and
live under the same roof as his master.  For some reasons
he relished the change, since it would now be easier to
devote a little more personal attention to Hilary.  He could
see no faults in him; he pandered to Woodrow's lethargic
nature as far as he was able; he stuck stoutly to it that
the farmer was not a robust man and must be considered
in every way possible.
</p>

<p>
The time sped and Winter returned.  Then Sarah Jane,
her education with regard to milk and butter complete,
came home, and Daniel began to clamour for marriage.
Mr. Friend finally decided that the season of Spring should
be chosen.  For himself he had planned to live henceforth
in a little building at the peat-works.  He held that a few
slates and stones, some mortar and a pail of whitewash,
would render it habitable.  An engineer had paid one of
his rare, periodic visits to the works, made some suggestions
and departed again.  Therefore Gregory was full of
new hopes.  There had also come increasing demands for
Amicombe peat from various sources, and he was very busy
with a trolly on the old tram-line.  He loaded it from his
stores, then steered it down the winding ways of the Moor,
discharged his fuel near the railway station, and, with one
strong horse to drag the trolly, climbed back again to his
boggy fastness behind Great Links.
</p>

<p>
The banns were called at Lydford, and Sarah Jane and
Daniel listened to them.  He burnt under his brown skin;
she betrayed interest, but no visible embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
At this season Jarratt Weekes was much occupied by
business, into which he plunged somewhat deeply as a
distraction.  Widow Routleigh passed away, and it was known
that her cottage had been purchased by the castle-keeper;
but circumstances suspended the operations on the water-leat,
and its advent at Lydford became delayed by a year.
Therefore the advantages accruing to his new property were
not yet patent to every eye, and only Jarratt and his mother
knew the real quality of his bargain.  In other directions
he had obliged his enemy Mr. Churchward with a loan,
because an opportunity arose for putting "the Infant,"
Adam's son, into business.  William Churchward joined
a bookseller in Tavistock.  The occupation, as his father
explained, was genteel and intellectual, and might lead to
higher things.  From William's point of view his work was
sedentary and slight, and led to hearty thirst after the
shutters were put up.  He lived with his senior partner,
pursued his efforts at picture-painting, and often came home
at the end of the week.
</p>

<p>
No further meeting to discuss the water-leat celebrations
had been called after the postponement was announced.  But
Mr. Churchward only waited a fitting time to proceed with
his plans.  The committee was understood to continue to
exist, and Mr. Nathaniel Spry still flattered the
schoolmaster; Mr. Norseman still went in doubt as to the
propriety of the enterprise; Mr. Pearn still talked about his
free luncheon; and Mr. Huggins still laboured under the
thought of impersonating Moses.
</p>

<p>
Then came the wedding day and the wedding ceremony.
Save for the master, Ruddyford was empty, because all
asked and obtained leave to see Daniel married.  Dunnagoat
cot was not large enough to hold the wedding guests, and
its inaccessible position made it impossible in any case.
Therefore Mr. Friend, who insisted on straining his
resources to the extent of a banquet, borrowed an empty
cottage near the church, and with the assistance of
Mr. Pearn and his staff, arranged a very handsome entertainment.
</p>

<p>
There were present the company from Ruddyford; and
Mr. Churchward and his daughter also accepted Gregory's
hospitality; for Mary Churchward and Sarah Jane were old
acquaintance, and Mary, in secret, had liked Sarah Jane
the more for refusing Jarratt Weekes.  Mr. Huggins,
Mr. Norseman and the latter's wife also attended; and five or
six other men and women, with their grown-up sons and
daughters, completed a throng of about twenty persons.
Many more came to the church ceremony, and all frankly
agreed that such a splendid man and woman had not within
living memory been linked at St. Petrock's.  But the house
of Weekes was unrepresented, save by Susan.  She had
taken occasion to run away at dawn; and she thoroughly
enjoyed the great event, without any uneasiness as to the
future.  Her aunt would be far too interested at learning
all particulars, to waste time in reproaches and admonishment.
</p>

<p>
So Daniel Brendon and Sarah Jane Friend were wedded,
and, having spent a week in Plymouth and watched the
wonder of the sea, they returned to their little home at
Ruddyford and joyfully set about the business of life.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br><br>
THE GATES OF THE MORNING
</h3>

<p>
Dawn had woven her own texture of pearl into the fabric
of the Moor, and the sun, like a great lamp, hung low upon
the shoulder of the eastern hills.  Silence brooded, save for
the murmur of water, and all things were still but the
stream, upon whose restless currents morning wrote in letters
of pale gold.  The world glimmered under sparkling moisture
born of a starry night, and every blade of grass and
frond of fern lifted its proper jewel to the sun.  Peace
held the waking hour a while, and living man still slept as
soundly as the old stone heroes in their forgotten graves
beneath the heather.  Then newborn things began to suck
the udder, or open little bills for food.  Parent birds and
beasts were busy tending upon their young.  The plovers
mewed far off, and swooped and tumbled; curlews cried;
herons took the morning upon their wings and swept low
and heavily to their hunting grounds.
</p>

<p>
Young dawn danced golden-footed over the stony hills,
fired the greater gorse, lighted each granite pinnacle like a
torch, flooded the world with radiance, and drank the dew
of the morning.  Earth also awoke, and her sleeping garb
of pearly mist, still spread upon the river valleys, at length
dwindled, and glowed, and burnt away into the ardent air.
Then incense of peat-smoke ascended in a transparent veil
of blue above Ruddyford, while from the cot hard by came
forth a woman.
</p>

<p>
Sarah Jane had been at her new life a week, and began
to know the cows and their characters.  They waited for
her now, and soon the milk purred into her glittering pails.
First the note of the can was sharp and thin; then, as the
precious fluid spirted, now right, now left, from the teats
under Sarah's firm fingers, the vessel uttered a milder
harmony and finally gave out only a dull thud with each
addition.  The cows waited their turns patiently, licked
one another's necks and lowed; as yet no man moved, and
the milker amused herself by talking to the kine.  She sat
with her cheek pressed to a great red flank, and her hair
shone cowslip-colour against the russet hide of the beast.
Her splendid arms were bare to the elbow.  Already
something of the past had vanished from her, and in her eyes
new thought was added to the old frankness.  She thought
upon motherhood as she milked these placid mothers; she
perceived that the summer world was full of mothers
wheeling the air and walking on earth.  Wifehood was
good to her, and very dearly she loved the man who had
led her into it.
</p>

<p>
Sarah Jane whistled sometimes when she felt unusually
cheerful.  She whistled now, and her red lips creased up
till they resembled the breaking bud of a flower.  The sounds
she uttered were deep and full, like a blackbird's song, and
they made no set tune, but rippled in harmonious, sweet,
irregular notes, as an accompaniment to kindred thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly feet fell on the stone pavement outside the
cow-byres, and a man approached where she sat and milked
the last cow.  The others, each in turn, her store yielded,
had passed through an open gate into the Moor, there to
browse and repose and chew the cud until another evening.
</p>

<p>
Sarah Jane glanced up and saw Hilary Woodrow standing
and looking at her.  As yet she had but seen him once upon
a formal introduction; now he stopped and spoke to her.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, Mrs. Brendon.  I hope your house is
comfortable, and that you are settling down.  Let Tabitha
know if she can do anything for you."
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, sir, and thank you.  'Tis a very snug
li'l house, and nothing could be nicer."
</p>

<p>
He nodded.  Then the last cow went off, and Sarah Jane
rose, patted it on the flank and stretched her arms.  He
remarked her height and splendid figure.
</p>

<p>
"Rather cramping work, I'm afraid," he said.
</p>

<p>
"'Twas at first, but I like it better now.  Cows be nice,
cosy creatures an' terrible understanding.  Some's so
peaceful an' quiet; an' others that masterful they won't take
'no' for an answer, an' push afore the patient ones and
get their own way, and will be milked first."
</p>

<p>
He nodded once more and smiled.  Then she washed her
hands in a granite trough of sweet water and spoke again.
</p>

<p>
"You'm moving early," she remarked, in her easy and
friendly fashion.  "John Prout said you always laid late
for health, yet you be up afore the men."
</p>

<p>
"I slept badly and was glad to get out into this sun."
</p>

<p>
"You'm over-thin seemingly, and have a hungry look,
sir.  Here&mdash;wait a minute!  Bide where you be, and I'll
come back afore you can count ten!"
</p>

<p>
She vanished into Ruddyford, and Hilary, wondering,
watched her swift, splendid speed.  In a moment she
returned with an empty glass.  She filled it from the
milk-pail and held it to him.
</p>

<p>
"Drink," she said.  "'Tis what you'm calling out for."
</p>

<p>
"I can't, Mrs. Brendon&mdash;raw milk doesn't suit me."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you believe that!  Milk hot out of the cow suits
everybody.  Take it so, and you'll get rounder and happier
in a week.  My own father was largely the better for it.
Try, sir; do please."
</p>

<p>
He could not resist her eyes, and took the glass from her
hands and thanked her.
</p>

<p>
"Here's good luck and all prosperity to you and your
husband," he said, and emptied the glass.
</p>

<p>
Her face brightened with pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"Lick your lips," she begged.  "Don't lose a drop of
it: 'tis life&mdash;milk's the very beginning of life&mdash;so my
mother used to tell."
</p>

<p>
"And do you think this cup is the beginning of mine?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;yours beginned fifty year ago by the look of you.
But milk will help you.  You're just the thin, poor-fed
fashion of man as ought to drink it.  My Daniel's different.
With his huge thews he must have red meat&mdash;like a dear
old tiger.  Milk's no use to him."
</p>

<p>
"By Jove&mdash;d'you think I look fifty, Mrs. Brendon?"
he asked.
</p>

<p>
"To my eye, I should guess you wasn't much under.
Beg pardon, I'm sure, if you be."
</p>

<p>
"I'm thirty-six," he said.
</p>

<p>
"My stars!  Then you ought to take more care of yourself."
</p>

<p>
"I sleep badly."
</p>

<p>
"You think too much belike?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;there's a lot to think about."
</p>

<p>
"You did ought to put a bit of wool round your neck
when you come out in the morning air, perhaps," she
suggested; but he laughed at this.
</p>

<p>
"Good gracious!  I'm not made of sugar.  I look a giant
of strength beside town folk.  'Tis only in your eye that
all of us seem weaklings beside Brendon.  To tell you the
truth, I'm rather a fool about my health.  I said just now
I had so much to think about: don't you believe it!  I've
got nothing to think about&mdash;hardly more than the cows.
Now, I mustn't waste any more of your time."
</p>

<p>
He sauntered on towards the Moor.
</p>

<p>
Daniel Brendon was standing at his entrance as
Woodrow approached, and he touched his hat and said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Morning, sir!"
</p>

<p>
"Morning, Dan," the master answered and passed on.
</p>

<p>
Sarah Jane took her milk-pails to the dairy, and then
went home to breakfast.  She chattered to her husband,
narrated her morning's experience, and explained at length
her theories of Hilary Woodrow.
</p>

<p>
"To think as he be no more than six-and-thirty!" she
said.
</p>

<p>
"How d'you know that?"
</p>

<p>
"He told me.  I forget how it went, but I'd just said
I reckoned he was fifty, and he seemed rather troubled."
</p>

<p>
"Fancy your speaking like that!"
</p>

<p>
"He don't look much less, all the same.  And I gave
him a bit of advice too."
</p>

<p>
"Advise him!  Nought stops you," Daniel said with his
mouth full.
</p>

<p>
"Why should it?  After you've been married a month&mdash;there
'tis&mdash;you've got more wisdom and understanding of
menfolk than a century of maiden life could bring to 'e.  I
feel like a mother to these here helpless men a'ready."
</p>

<p>
"Never was such a large-hearted female as you, Sarah
Jane."
</p>

<p>
"What that man wants is a wife.  I couldn't have read
him any more than you could a bit ago; now 'tis as plain
to my understanding as this cup of tea.  A wisht, hangdog,
sorrowful face to my eye; yet very good-looking in
his thin way.  But hungry&mdash;awful hungry."
</p>

<p>
"As to women, he's had enough of them.  One treated
him shameful.  But 'tisn't them: 'tis his terrible vain
ideas about religion makes him fretful, I reckon.  Well he
may be hungry!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't you believe that," she answered.  "Church-going
don't put fat on the bones, whatever else it may do.
He should have a female after him, to fuss a bit, and coddle
him, and see he lets his proper food down.  He wants
somebody to listen to his talk&mdash;somebody to sharpen his
wits on."
</p>

<p>
With startling intuition of truth she spoke; but Daniel
did not appreciate her discernment.
</p>

<p>
"Fewer that listen to his talk, the better," he said.
"Ban't likely Mr. Woodrow will be happy so long as he
sucks poison out of all sorts of godless books."
</p>

<p>
"Poison is as poison does," she answered.  "Everybody
says he's a very good sort of man.  The good man
can't be godless."
</p>

<p>
"Because his Maker's stronger than his opinions and
ban't sleeping, though Woodrow's conscience may be.  In
time of trouble I wouldn't give a rush for his way.  There's
nought to help then but Heaven; and so he'll find it.  Not
that I judge&mdash;only I'm sorry for it."
</p>

<p>
"He wants a woman after him," repeated Sarah Jane
decisively.
</p>

<p>
Daniel laughed at her.
</p>

<p>
"You think, because you and me are married, that
nobody can be happy otherwise."
</p>

<p>
"Men and women must come to it for sartain, if they'm
to be complete, and shine afore their fellow-creatures.  A
bachelor's an unfinished thing; and so's a maiden&mdash;I don't
care who she is.  And she knows it at the bottom of her
heart, for all she pretends different."
</p>

<p>
"That's not Christianity," Daniel answered; "and you
oughtn't to say it, or think it.  You speak in the first flush
of being married; and I feel just the same and scorn a
single man; but 'tis silly nonsense, and we'm both wrong.
The saints and martyrs was mostly single, and the holiest
Christians that ever lived haven't found no use for women
as a rule.  Christ's Self wasn't married for that matter."
</p>

<p>
She considered this view, then shook her head unconvinced.
</p>

<p>
"He went to marriages and was kind to the women.
He might have found the right maiden Himself, and won
joy of her after He'd set the world right, if they hadn't
killed Him."
</p>

<p>
Daniel stared.
</p>

<p>
"Don't say things like that, Sarah Jane!  You don't
mean it for profane speaking; but 'tis very near it, and
makes me feel awful scared."
</p>

<p>
"What have I said now, dear heart?  I never know
what you think 'bout things.  You change so.  If 'tis holier
and better to bide single&mdash;but there&mdash;what foolishness!
Jesus Christ set store by little children anyway; and He
knowed you can't have 'em without getting 'em."
</p>

<p>
Brendon rose up from the table and kissed her neck.
</p>

<p>
"You'm a darling creature," he said, "and to look at
you be to make single life but a frosty thing in a man's
eyes, no doubt.  Certainly 'twould be false for me to say
a word against marriage; only it ban't for all; and the
Christian religion shows that there are many can do more
useful work out of it than in it."
</p>

<p>
"Poor things!" she said in her pride.  "Let 'em do
what they can, then.  But I'd be sorry to think that a
churchyard stone, getting crookeder every year, was all
that was left to remember me by when I went."
</p>

<p>
"That's your narrowness, Sarah.  There's other
contrivances beside babbies that a man or a woman can bring
into the world.  Goodness and proper actions, and setting
an example, and such like."
</p>

<p>
"Parson's work," she said.  "What's that to taking
your share in the little ones?  If I thought us should have
no childer, I'd so soon hang myself as not, Dan."
</p>

<p>
"Your ideas do hurtle about my ears like hail," he said,
"And they'm awful wild and silly sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"I know it.  You'll larn me better come presently."
</p>

<p>
"I hope so," he said.  "You're all right at heart&mdash;only
the pattern of your ideas now and then be a thought too
outlandish for a Christian home.  You wasn't taught all
you've got to larn.  I don't say it out of no disrespect to
father; but&mdash;well&mdash;us all have a deal to larn yet&mdash;the oldest
and youngest&mdash;and me most of all."
</p>

<p>
Daniel heaved a contented sigh upon this platitude, and
his day's work began.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0203"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br><br>
PROGRESS IN IDEAS
</h3>

<p>
The Brendons always went to morning service at Lydford
on Sunday.  Sometimes Mr. Tapson, who was a churchman,
accompanied them; but Agg and Lethbridge belonged
to another sect, and their place of worship was at Mary Tavy.
Neither John Prout nor his sister ever went.  Indeed,
Sunday dinner occupied the great part of Tabitha's energies
on every seventh day.
</p>

<p>
Once, being early for service, Daniel and Sarah Jane
wandered amid the tombs, and then sat down upon the
churchyard wall and looked out over a wooded gorge
beneath.  Brendon was always very serious and sober on
Sunday.  It seemed to his wife that he donned a mental
habit with his black coat, and in her heart she rejoiced when
the day had passed.  He looked strictly after her religion
from the time of their marriage, and had lengthened her
morning and evening prayers considerably with additions
from his own.  She fell in readily with his wishes, and was
obedient as a child; but none the less she knew that the
inward and spiritual signs he foretold from her increased
religious activity, delayed their appearance.  The daily act
of faith was not necessary to her mental health, and it
proved powerless to alter her natural bent of thought.
Sometimes she still shocked him, but less often than of
old.
</p>

<p>
She loved him with a great love; and love taught her
to understand his stern soul a little.  Not fear, but
affection, made her careful.  Meantime her own attitude to life
and her own frank and joyous spirit were absolutely
unchanged.  Only, from consideration for him, she hid her
thought a little, and often shut her mouth upon an opinion,
because she remembered that it might give him pain.
</p>

<p>
"Do you ever think about the graves?" asked her husband,
looking round thoughtfully at the grass-clad hillocks.
But she kept her eyes before her and only shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"No, Dan&mdash;can't say as I do.  The churchyard's the
place for dead men&mdash;not living ones.  Us shall spend a
terrible lot of time here come presently, and I don't want
to waste much of it here now."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a steadying job to read the verses above all these
bones," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Read 'em, then," she answered.  "But don't ax me
to.  I hate graves, and I hate everything to do with death.
With all my might I hate it."
</p>

<p>
"You shouldn't feel so.  'Tis a part of life, and no
more can we have life without it, than we can have a book
without a last page.  And no one of all these men carried
anything into the next world but his record in this.  Yet
to remember how soon we must give up our clay be a
solemn, useful thought."
</p>

<p>
She did not answer, and he strolled apart and considered
the trite warnings, pious hopes, and implicit pathos of dates,
where figures often told the saddest tale.
</p>

<p>
A man came into the churchyard, and, looking round,
Daniel, very greatly to his astonishment, saw Jarratt
Weekes talking to his wife.  Scarcely believing his own
eyes, he strode over a row of the silent people and
approached.
</p>

<p>
Neither his wife nor himself had spoken to the castle-keeper
since their marriage; yet at last it seemed that the
rejected suitor was recovering from his disappointment and
about to forget and forgive the past.  Weekes shook hands
with Brendon, as he had already done with Sarah Jane;
then he addressed them both.
</p>

<p>
"I'm hoping as you'll let bygones be bygones, Brendon.
I was hard hit, and&mdash;well, 'tis no good going over old
ground.  I did my best to get you away from Sarah Jane
here, and I failed.  There's no more to be said."
</p>

<p>
"Except that you didn't fight fair," answered Daniel
calmly.  "You tried by very underhand ways to do me
out of my own, and I'm sorry for it.  All the same, I'm
willing enough to forgive you and be friendly henceforth,
Mr. Weekes."
</p>

<p>
"So am I," declared Sarah Jane.  "'Twas a very great
kindness in you to be so fond of me, and I never shall
forget it.  But there was but one man in the world for me
after I met Daniel here, and so I hope there won't be no
more feeling against us."
</p>

<p>
"Not on my side there won't," answered Jarratt.  "I'm
glad to let it go.  Life's too short to harbour any bitterness
like that.  I hope you'll be happy all your days, and if
ever I can serve you, Brendon, you've only got to tell me
so."
</p>

<p>
Daniel glowed with satisfaction, took the other's hand
again and shook it.
</p>

<p>
"This is an extra good Sunday for me," he answered,
"and nothing better could have happened.  And I'll say
no more, except that I trust it may come into my power
to do you good some day, Mr. Weekes.  Which I will do,
God helping."
</p>

<p>
"So be it," said the other.  "I'll hold you friendly in
my mind, henceforward&mdash;both of you."
</p>

<p>
He did not look at Brendon during this conversation, but
sometimes cast a side glance into Sarah Jane's face.  Now
folk began to enter the churchyard, and presently the bells
rang.
</p>

<p>
During service Brendon very heartily thanked Heaven
for this happy event, and blessed his Maker, in that He had
touched the angry heart of Jarratt Weekes to penitence.
But Sarah Jane regarded the incident with a spirit less than
prayerful.  She was hardly convinced that her old lover
meant friendship henceforth.  She knew what he had
attempted against Daniel; she remembered the things that
he had said to her; and this sudden change of mind and
expression of contrition found her sceptical.
</p>

<p>
As for Weekes himself, he had acted upon impulse and
the accident of meeting them alone.  But his motives were
involved.  He was not yet done with Sarah Jane.  He
rather wished to punish her, since he could not possess
her.  He certainly had not forgiven, and still desired
revenge.  Therefore he pretended a sudden regret, deceived
Brendon, and so ordered his apologies that henceforth he
might pose as a friend.  He had, however, little thought
of what he would do, and revenge was by no means the
dominating idea of his mind at present.  Much else occupied
it, and so busy was he, that he knew quite well nothing
practical might ever spring from his secret dislike of the
Brendons.  Time might even deaden the animosity, before
opportunity arose to gratify it; but, on the other hand, with
free intercourse once established, anything might fall out.
So he left the situation vague for chance to develop.  His
malignancy was chronic rather than acute.  It might leap
into activity by the accident of events; or perish, smothered
under the press of his affairs.
</p>

<p>
As they returned home from church, Sarah Jane warned
her husband to place no absolute trust in the things that
he had heard from Jarratt Weekes; but Daniel blamed her
for doubting.  He explained that Mr. Weekes was a
Christian man and a regular attendant at worship.  He felt
positive that the other was truly contrite, and out of his
own nature accepted these assurances without suspicion.
He went further, and blamed his wife for her doubt.
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't be small like that," he said.  "It isn't
worthy of you."
</p>

<p>
"I know him better than you do.  He was very much
in love with me.  He offered me a horse if I'd have
him.  That was pretty good for such a mean man as
him."
</p>

<p>
"You must always allow for the part that God plays in
a person.  When anybody says or does a thing outside his
character, don't jump to the idea he's lying or playing a
part.  But just ask yourself if God may not have touched
the man and lifted him higher than himself."
</p>

<p>
"You can't be higher than yourself&mdash;so Mr. Woodrow
says.  I forget what we was telling about, but, coming for
his milk one morning, he got very serious and full of
religious ideas."
</p>

<p>
Daniel frowned.
</p>

<p>
"There's no true foundation to his opinions&mdash;always
remember that."
</p>

<p>
"He's just as religious as you, in his own way, all the
same," she said.  "He told me religion be like clothes.
If it fits, well and good; but 'tis no good trying to tinker
and patch up the Bible to make it suit your case if it won't.
I dimly see what the man means."
</p>

<p>
"Do you?&mdash;well, I don't, and I don't want to; and I
won't have him talk to you so; I ban't too pleased at this
caper of his, to come out every morning for a glass of
warm milk when you'm with the cows."
</p>

<p>
"And of an evening too, he comes."
</p>

<p>
"It must be stopped, then.  He shall talk no more of
his loose opinions to you. 'Tinker and patch the Bible'!
What will he say next?  Sometimes I feel a doubt if I did
ought to bide here at all.  I'm not sure if one should be
working and taking the money of a man's that not a
Christian."
</p>

<p>
"He's a good man enough.  I've heard you say yourself
that you never met a better."
</p>

<p>
"I know it.  And that's the mystery.  I hope he'll
come round and see truth as the years pass by."
</p>

<p>
"He's the better for the milk, and a kinder creature
never walked," said Sarah Jane.
</p>

<p>
In truth she had seen a good deal of Hilary Woodrow
since first he strolled abroad after a sleepless night and
drank at her bidding.  It pleased him to find her at her
work, for she was always the first to be stirring; and now he
had fallen into the way of rising early, walking in the air,
and talking with the dairymaid while she milked the cows.
</p>

<p>
Sarah Jane, in some small measure, appeared to have
revived his faith and interest in women.  Her artless
outlook upon life came as a novelty to him.  Everything
interested her; nothing shocked her.  An almost sexless purity
of mind characterized her speeches.  An idea entering her
brain came forth again chastened and sweetened.  Her very
plainness of speech made for purgation of thought.  The
things called "doubtful" were disinfected when she spoke
about them.
</p>

<p>
Hilary Woodrow found Daniel's wife not seldom in his
head, and as time advanced he grew to anticipate the dawn
with pleasure, and looked forward to the fresh milk of her
thoughts, rather than that she brought him from the cow.
</p>

<p>
He protested sometimes at the narrowness of the opinions
round about, and told her, with gloomy triumph, that
certain local ministers of the church declined to know him.
</p>

<p>
"Which is best," he asked, "to say that every man is
born wicked, as they do, or say that every man is born
good, like I do?  Why, 'tis to condemn without a trial to
say that every man is born wicked."
</p>

<p>
"Men be born little, dear, dinky babbies," she said&mdash;"no
more wicked than they blind kittens in the loft."
</p>

<p>
"Of course not; but that's dogma.  They find it in the
Bible.  It's called the Fall.  I can't talk to the men about
these things&mdash;except Prout.  But I wish I could get at your
husband a bit, because he's in earnest.  The fault with
earnest folk so often is, that they never will understand
other people are earnest too."
</p>

<p>
"He knows you'm very good, sir, for all your opinions."
</p>

<p>
"You see, conscience and the moral sense are two
different things; but Brendon would never allow that.  He
says that conscience comes from God.  I say it is what
you've been taught, or learned for yourself.  If I believed
in God&mdash;then I'd say the moral sense was what came direct
from Him.  But I don't, and so I explain it by the laws of
Evolution."
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"That's all a rigmarole to me, though I dare say Dan
would follow it.  You don't believe in no God at all, then?"
</p>

<p>
"None at all&mdash;not the shadow of the shade of a God."
</p>

<p>
In her blue eyes nothing but the sky was reflected; in
his there was much of earth; and his own earth was
unrestful as he looked at her morning loveliness.
</p>

<p>
"Drink your milk afore the warmth be out of it," she
said.  "'Twould be a terrible curious thing if there was no
God, certainly."
</p>

<p>
"The sun's my God."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, there is a God&mdash;though we don't see
over-much of Him up here."
</p>

<p>
"But we believe in him, and trust him with the seed,
and the lambs; and know that he'll bring back Spring again
when Winter is done.  So, after all, I'm talking nonsense,
because I've got as great faith in my god as your husband
has in his."
</p>

<p>
"To hear you run on!  Like a book, I'm sure."
</p>

<p>
"I can talk like this to you, because you don't look at
me as if I was damned and you weren't sorry for it.  That's
what I get from most people.  Have you ever read about
Jehovah and the burnt offerings and the sin offerings, and
how His altar was to be sprinkled with fresh blood all day
long, and how the dumb beasts and birds were to be torn
to pieces for a sweet savour before Him?  That's the
blood-sucking vampire the parsons think made the stars, and the
flowers, and&mdash;you!  I wish I'd lived a hundred years later:
then I shouldn't have been fretted with so many fools,
Sarah Jane."
</p>

<p>
"Us ought to live and let live, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
"Charity&mdash;that's all I ask.  I only want 'em to practise
the first and last thing their Lord begged for, and preached
for, and prayed for."
</p>

<p>
"You'm very charitable, I'm sure&mdash;and never name the
kind things you do&mdash;though John Prout tells about them."
</p>

<p>
"Does he?  No, no, they're in his imagination.  Prout
spoils me and thinks too well of me.  So do you."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry for you, because you've got such a lot of
queer opinions, seemingly, and none to let 'em off upon.
You must feel like bursting with trouble sometimes, from
the look of your eyes."
</p>

<p>
He laughed at that and abruptly left her.  It was his
custom now to appear and depart without any formal salute.
Sometimes, after absence of days, he would suddenly be at
her side after dawn, or at evening.  Then he would resume
the thread of his last speeches, as though no interval had
fallen between.
</p>

<p>
There was no secrecy in these interviews, and often
another, or Brendon himself, might be present at them.
But when once Woodrow appealed to Daniel, before his
wife, to be larger-minded and more tolerant, the giant shook
his head.  He held it wickedness to be easy with wrong
ideas.  To him that man was dishonest, who had not the
courage of his own opinions; and disloyal, who could even
endure arguments directed against his faith.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
SATURDAY NIGHT
</h3>

<p>
After heavy rain the evening cleared awhile and the sky
showed palest blue, touched with little clouds that carried
the sunset fire.  But banks of mist already began to roll
up with night, and their vans, as they billowed along the
south, were touched with rose.  Darkness swiftly followed;
the world faded away under a cold fog, that increased in
density until all things were hidden and smothered by it.
Into the valleys it rolled, swept croft and heath and the
channels of the rivers, sank into the deep lanes, searched
the woods, spread darker than night upon the lowlands.
Outside the Castle Inn it hung like wool, and across it,
from the windows of the bar, streamed out radiance of genial
light.  But this illumination was choked within a dozen
yards of its starting point; and, if a door was opened, the
fog crept in with the visitor.
</p>

<p>
Men appeared to take their familiar parts in the drinking
and talking of Saturday night, and each made a similar
comment on the unusual density of the mist, each rubbed
the dewy rime from his hair as he entered.
</p>

<p>
"If it freezes 'pon this, us shall have a proper sight of
ammil in the trees to-morrow," said Mr. Jacob Taverner,
who was of the company.  "I haven't seen that wonder
for ten years now; but well I can mind it.  'Twas a day
soon after the beginning of the New Year&mdash;even as this
might be; and us rose up to find every twig and bough, and
stone and fuzz bush coated with pure ice, like glass.  The
sun played upon the country, and never such a dazzle was
seen.  'Twas like a fairy story&mdash;all the world turned to
gold and precious gems a-glittering.  As Huggins said, it
might have been the New Jerusalem itself, if it hadn't been
so plaguey cold along with.  Didn't you, Val?"
</p>

<p>
"I did say so&mdash;I remember them words," answered
Mr. Huggins from his corner.  "Cold enough to freeze the
bird on the bough 'twas.  I hope it won't never go so
chill again, while I'm spared, for 'twould carry me off
without a doubt."
</p>

<p>
"You'll live to play Moses an' walk along with
St. Petrock yet," said Mr. Pearn slily.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Huggins always became uneasy when Moses was
mentioned; and this his friends well knew.
</p>

<p>
"I wish the water had run to Lydford when 'twas first
planned.  This putting off for a year be very improper in
my opinion," declared Taverner; and Mr. Adam Churchward,
from his snug seat behind a leathern screen near the
fire, replied:
</p>

<p>
"We can't honestly throw the blame on anybody, Jacob.
You see, they were suddenly confronted with some engineering
difficulties in getting the water over the railway cutting.
'Tis not as easy as they thought to do it.  And then there
was another trouble in that hollow full of springs under
the Tavistock road.  But I have no hesitation in saying,
after my recent conversation with the deputy assistant
engineer, that the water will be here definitely by June
next, or Autumn at latest."
</p>

<p>
"Will you call up another committee then?" asked Mr. Huggins.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly I shall.  Spry wrote out the minutes of the
last meeting, and will be able to refresh your minds as to
what was proposed and seconded all in form and order."
</p>

<p>
"How's 'the Infant' faring to Tavistock?" asked Mr. Pearn.
"I was offered five shilling for that there little
picture of the Castle he made a while back, and give me for
a bad debt.  It hangs over your head, Huggins."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Churchward was familiar with the sketch, and nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he has the artist's instinct.  He colours still, I
believe, and has sold one or two little trifles at Tavistock.
He doesn't take to the book business, I find.  If we could
but get a patron for him&mdash;somebody to send him to London
free of expense to develop the possibilities of art.  But
patrons are things of the past."
</p>

<p>
"Else you would be in a higher sphere yourself, no
doubt, schoolmaster."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Taverner.  But I am quite content.
<i>Multum in parvo</i>, as we say.  I get much into little.  I
hope the rising generation will show that I have done my
duty, if not more than my duty."
</p>

<p>
"Be they a very on-coming lot, or thick-headed?"
inquired Mr. Huggins.  "I often think if us old men had
had such chances to larn as the boys nowadays, that we
should have made a stir in the nation.  Anyway, we stood
to work in a fashion I never see of late years.  Hard as
nails we used to be.  Now&mdash;my stars! you'll see the childer
going to school under umbrellas!  'Tis a great sign of
weakness in my opinion, and ought to be stopped."
</p>

<p>
"As to the main question," answered Adam, "my
youthful charges may be considered rather under than over
the average in their intellects.  With the exception of
Johnny Williams and his brother Arthur, I should say my
present classes will leave the world pretty much as they
find it.  I need not tell you that I inculcate high moral
principles; and in that respect they are as good and honest
a lot of boys as Lydford has ever turned out&mdash;or any other
centre of instruction.  But as to book learning&mdash;no."
</p>

<p>
"Too many school treats and holidays, in my opinion,"
said Jarratt Weekes.
</p>

<p>
He had just entered, and was shaking himself like a
dog that emerges from the water.
</p>

<p>
"Hold on!" cried Jacob Taverner.  "What be about?"
</p>

<p>
Weekes took off his coat and flung it on a settle.
</p>

<p>
"The usual," he said to Mr. Pearn, and, while his drink
was being poured, turned to the schoolmaster.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis all of a piece&mdash;the softness of the times," he said.
"You larn boys to be lazy to school.  I don't say it specially
of your school.  'Tis the same at all of 'em.  Look at your
own son."
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't say that," answered Adam.  "I cannot
suffer it.  You ought to remember that the average of
human brain power is exceedingly low.  I am always
against putting too much strain on the human mind on
principle.  Our lunatic asylums are the result of putting
too much strain&mdash;not only on the mind, but on the body.
It should be the object of every schoolmaster to feel that,
come what may, no pupil of his shall ever be sent to a
lunatic asylum or to prison.  That has always been my
object, at any rate; and without self-praise I may say that
I have achieved it, except in the case of Thomas Drury,
the Saltash murderer."
</p>

<p>
"We're a canting lot of humbugs," said Weekes shortly.
"We think more of the fools of to-day than the wise men
of to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Quite right too," declared Mr. Pearn.  "They want
it more.  The wise men coming will think for themselves;
the fools can't."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; they'll think for themselves, and laugh at us,"
said Jarratt.
</p>

<p>
"Let 'em laugh," said Mr. Huggins.  "Who cares?
We shall be underground, in other Hands than theirs.
We shall answer to God A'mighty for our works, not to the
unborn."
</p>

<p>
"The unborn will judge us all the same&mdash;Weekes is
right there," admitted the schoolmaster.  "I always feel
the truth of that when I lift my rod.  I say to myself, 'this
erring child will some day be a father.  I am therefore not
only teaching him to keep the narrow road, but helping his
children and his grandchildren to do so.'  As I wield the
instrument of correction <i>in extremis</i>, I often think that I
may be moulding the character of some great man, who
will not draw his first breath until long after I am dust.
This may seem merely the imagination of the scholarly
mind, yet so it is.  Take your next with me, Weekes.  I
always like our conversation to be raised to a high pitch;
and you always do it."
</p>

<p>
Of late, to gain some private ends, Mr. Churchward
had resolutely ignored the ill-will of the castle-keeper.
Jarratt continued to treat him indifferently; but Adam
would never allow himself to be annoyed, and always offered
the cheek to the smiter.  Everybody perceived this change
of attitude, and everybody, including Mr. Churchward's
daughter, knew the reason.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Weekes nodded and his glass was filled again.
</p>

<p>
"I hope your mother be having good trade?" asked
Noah Pearn.  "I hear that the Christmas markets touched
high water this year."
</p>

<p>
"All we could wish," admitted Jarratt.  "She's worked
like ten women this winter."
</p>

<p>
"Very aggravating 'tis to hear it&mdash;to me," suddenly
declared a sad-looking, silent man, in a corner.  "There's
my wife might be doing the very same; but rabbit
it! she've never got time for nothing now.  We've gived up
our market stall altogether.  I've got to do everything of
late days.  I never thought she'd have changed like
that&mdash;else I'd never have took her."
</p>

<p>
"How many children have you got, Samuel?" asked
Mr. Huggins.
</p>

<p>
"But one," said Samuel gloomily.
</p>

<p>
"There 'tis!" cried the ancient.  "They'm all the same
with one&mdash;'tis the commonest thing.  But wait till she've
brought 'e half-a-dozen or more, and she'll have time for
everything&mdash;market included."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis strange but true, like other ways of Providence,"
declared Taverner; "but I've marked it in my own family,
that one child be far more trouble than six; an' takes far
more time.  'Tis the want of practice, no doubt."
</p>

<p>
Men came and went.  Presently Weekes prepared to
depart, and put on his coat again.
</p>

<p>
"Where's my father to-night?" he asked.  "'Tis past
his hour.  He had rather a dressing down afore mother
started this morning.  I should have thought he'd have
come for an extra glass in consequence."
</p>

<p>
"He never takes but four half pints of a Saturday night,
year in, year out," answered Mr. Pearn.  "Sometimes
he'll top up with a thimble of sloe gin, if the weather's
harsh; but that's his outside allowance."
</p>

<p>
"Life's a stormy voyage&mdash;without no harbour&mdash;for him,"
said Huggins.  "I don't speak disrespectfully of
Mrs. Weekes&mdash;very far from it&mdash;she's a born wonder; but one
of the sort built for wild weather.  She likes it; she'd droop
if everything went smooth."
</p>

<p>
"Everything do go smooth," said Jarratt.
</p>

<p>
"She is like a stately vessel that casts up foam from its
prow," declared the schoolmaster.  "Mrs. Weekes is a
lesson to Lydford, as I have always maintained, and always
shall do."
</p>

<p>
The husband of the stately vessel appeared at this
moment.
</p>

<p>
"Be blessed if I didn't miss the door," he said.  "Never
remember such a fog.  'Twill be blind man's buff to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
He sighed and came to the fire.
</p>

<p>
"Have a drink, father," said Jarratt, as to an inferior.
But Philip shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Not yet, Jar, thank 'e.  I must get a thought warmer
first.  I'll smoke my pipe a bit."
</p>

<p>
"Down on his luck he is to-day," explained the younger
Weekes.  "Down on his luck&mdash;because he don't know his
luck&mdash;eh, father?"
</p>

<p>
Philip did not answer; conversation became general, and
the castle-keeper departed.
</p>

<p>
Then, when he had gone, Noah Pearn endeavoured to
cheer his customer.
</p>

<p>
"Us have got some hot ale here wi' a nutmeg and a bit 'o
toast in it, my dear," he said.  "You sup a drop and 'twill
brace your sinews.  The cold have touched 'e perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Noah," said Mr. Weekes, and took the
glass.  "You're very good, I'm sure.  I've had a lot on
my mind to-day."
</p>

<p>
"She'd be a fine woman, if there was a thought less
lemon in her," said Taverner soothingly.
</p>

<p>
"She is a fine woman," answered Mr. Weekes, "&mdash;fine
enough for anything; but fine weather's no good if you'm
bedridden, and a fine woman's no good to her husband if
she won't&mdash;however, us needn't wash our dirty linen in
public.  We've all our defects."
</p>

<p>
"Almost too high-spirited, if I may venture to say so,"
declared Mr. Churchward.  "She has the courage of the
masculine gender."
</p>

<p>
"So have I, if I was let bide," explained Philip.  "That's
the mischief of it.  If I'd been a sort of weak man, ready to
go under, and do woman's work, and play second fiddle
happily, it wouldn't have mattered; but I ban't at all that
sort of man by nature, and it hurts my feelings to be made
to do it."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure you'm too wise to rebel, however," said
Mr. Huggins.  "'Twas much the same with me, and often I
wish I'd been so sensible as you; but my manly spirit
wouldn't brook nothing of that sort.  'I won't have it!'
I used to say in my fierce way.  But I'm sorry now,
because she might have been alive yet if I'd been a thought
easier with her."
</p>

<p>
Noah Pearn winked behind the back of Mr. Huggins at
the company generally, for it was well remembered that
Valentine's vanished partner had ruled him with a rod of
iron.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Weekes, however, showed no amusement.  In his
mind he was retracing certain painful recent incidents.
</p>

<p>
"Take what fell out this very day at morn," he said,
"to show how rash and wilful Mrs. Weekes can be of a
Saturday.  I was down in the garden attending to a thing
or two and packing a pair of birds for our own hamper.
Suddenly she came out of the house and began.  'Twas all
about Mrs. Swain, of course, and how I never can send
two birds of the same size, and how my goings-on will ruin
our custom and spoil business and fetch us to the poor-house
in our old age.  She was in full swing, souls, when down
comes Susan from the kitchen, running as if the dowl was
arter her.  'Oh, Aunt Hepsy!' she begins.  Then her
aunt cut her short, and told her not to dare open her silly
mouth while she was talking.  So Susan stood still and
the missis went on at me.  I was a greedy Gubbins, and a
traitor, and a wolf in sheep's clothing, and a lot of other
things; I was a reed shaken with the wind, a know-nought
gert mumphead, and suchlike.  Then, after ten
minutes of it, I should think, she turned to Susan, and
asked what she'd got to say.  The toad of a girl grinned in
our faces and said 'twas of no consequence, only a gert
strange dog, with a bit of broken rope round his neck, had
got into the kitchen and put his paws on the table and
growled at her, like a bear, and showed all his teeth at
once.  Well&mdash;there 'twas&mdash;you can guess what the room
looked like when I runned in.  The dog&mdash;I know whose
dog 'twas well enough!&mdash;had done just what he damn
pleased.  He only made off when he heard me coming, and
a muck heap's a neat, orderly place to what that kitchen
was after he'd gone.  Everything off the table, for he'd got
over the crockery to the bacon and swept the tea-pot and
things afore him like a river sweeps straws&mdash;bread, milk,
dripping&mdash;everything.  Never you seed such a masterpiece!
I lost my presence of mind and turned on the missis and
said, 'There&mdash;that's your work!  Let that be a lesson to
you, you chattering woman!'  I oughtn't to have said it,
and I was sorry enough after; but God He knows 'twill
be weeks afore I get in a word edgewise again.  She had
her spasms first; then she come to and let me catch it
hot and strong from the shoulder, I promise you.  She never
stopped.  While I drove her to the station, and shut the
carriage door on her, and the guard he whistled and the
train went, 'twas one shattering volume of speech.
However, I needn't trouble other people.  We've all got our
cares, no doubt."
</p>

<p>
They expressed sympathy with Philip's difficulties, and
Adam Churchward especially dwelt upon the bright side.
He reminded Mr. Weekes of the noble character of his son,
and explained that we all have the defects of our qualities,
and must give and take in a large and understanding spirit,
if we are to reach happiness, despite the adverse
circumstance of being human creatures.
</p>

<p>
These kindly words and his third glass of warm beer and
nutmeg comforted Philip; while the fourth and last found
him resigned even to the verge of renewed cheerfulness.
</p>

<p>
"Take my advice and say the word in season first minute
you see her to-morrow," said Mr. Pearn.  "Then, if the
market's been good, 'twill come all right."
</p>

<p>
"I will do so," promised Philip.  "That reminds me:
I must take a box o' straw to the station, for she was going
to fetch home a new tea-pot and a good few other things
with her.  'Twill all come right, and I dare say, after all,
'twasn't a bad thing that I forgot myself and put my foot
down so resolute.  She may think on it after."
</p>

<p>
"She will," foretold Jacob Taverner.  "Be sure she'll
think on it, and think none the worse of you for it.  They
like the manhood to flash out of us now and again&mdash;even
the most managing sort."
</p>

<p>
Closing time had come, and with great exclamations at
the density of the fog, Mr. Pearn's guests departed to their
homes.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br><br>
VISIT TO A HERMIT
</h3>

<p>
The evidences of former humanity that abound upon
Dartmoor may be divided into remains prehistoric and
mediæval.  Amid the first shall be found the ruins of the
stone-man's home and the scattered foundations of his
lodges and encampments.  To him also belong certain
cirques of stone lifted here and there in lonely places,
together with parallelitha, or avenues, and those menhirs and
cairns that rise solitary upon high hills to mark the
sleeping-places of neolithic heroes.  Profound antiquity wraps up
these memorials, and the significance of their record is still
matter of antiquarian doubt.  To what purpose was erected
the hypæthral chamber and the long aisle of stone, may
never now be understood; but later entries in the granite
cartulary of Dartmoor are more easily deciphered.  From
the middle ages date the tin-streamers' works, where Tudor
miners laboured; and scarce a river valley shall be searched
without offering many evidences of their toil; while upon
the higher grounds, marking some spot of special note,
indicating boundaries or serving as guide-posts from goal
to goal, the old stone crosses stand.
</p>

<p>
It was significant of the different attitudes of Sarah Jane
and her husband that she found a measure of interest in
the pagan hut-circle or grave; he only cared to see the
chance symbol of his faith.  These Christian evidences were
rare round about Ruddyford, but marks of the old stone men
did not lack, and Sarah Jane, to whom Hilary Woodrow
had once explained their meaning, always professed active
interest in these fragments, and told the things that she
had heard concerning them to her husband.
</p>

<p>
There came a Sunday in March when the Brendons went
up to see Gregory Friend, that they might convey a great
piece of news to him.  The young heather was rusty-red in
the shoot, and here and there swaling fires had scorched the
bosom of the hills to blackness.  The day was wintry, yet
clear, but many snug spots offered among the boulders,
where one might sit facing the sun and sheltered from the
east wind.
</p>

<p>
Such a place Brendon presently found and bade his wife
rest awhile.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis another of them hut-circles master tells about,"
said Sarah Jane.  "That was where the door opened without
a doubt.  To think as folk lived here, Dan&mdash;thousands
and thousands of years ago."
</p>

<p>
"Poor dust!  I like the crosses better: they be nearer
to our own time, I suppose, and mean a comfortabler thing.
'Tis wisht to hear farmer tell how savage, skin-clad folk
dwelt here afore the coming of Christ."
</p>

<p>
"They couldn't help coming afore He did.  He ought
to have come sooner, if He wanted for them to know about
Him," she answered.
</p>

<p>
Brendon frowned.
</p>

<p>
"You'm always so defiant," he said.  "I still catch the
master's way of speech in your tongue now and again.
An' very ugly it sounds."
</p>

<p>
"I'm bound to stop and listen to him sometimes, when
he begins to talk.  But since he comed of a morning for
his glass of milk and you stopped it&mdash;or I told him I'd rather
he didn't&mdash;us have had no words about holy things.  He's
got a side all the same."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry to hear you say so.  If you say so, you think
so, no doubt."
</p>

<p>
Sarah Jane laughed.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a free country&mdash;as far as thoughts be the matter."
</p>

<p>
"That's him again.  I heard him say the only sort of
freedom we could have was freedom of thought.  But
unbelievers shouldn't have that if I could help it."
</p>

<p>
She looked at him with love rather than respect.
</p>

<p>
"You'm deep but not wide in your way of thinking.  I
mind once last autumn coming to you and marking as you'd
been trampling in the whortleberries.  Your boots was all
red and purple, and it looked for all the world as if you
might have been stamping somebody to death."
</p>

<p>
"What things you say!"
</p>

<p>
"All the same now, be honest, Daniel&mdash;couldn't you do
it?  Can't you feel that things might happen so bad that
you'd even kill a person?  There's death in your eyes
sometimes, when you talk of evildoers, and them that are cruel
to children, and suchlike."
</p>

<p>
"'Tisn't a wifely thing to remind me I've got a temper.
You've never had to regret it, anyway."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know that?  But 'tis true: I never have.
You're a deal too soft with me, bless your big heart.  I can't
do wrong in your eyes; and yet, sometimes, I wonder how
you'd take it if I did do wrong&mdash;such wrong as there could
be no doubt about.  There's some things you'd kill me for,
I do believe."
</p>

<p>
"You'm talking to a Christian man; but you don't seem
to know it."
</p>

<p>
"A man be a man&mdash;Christian or heathen.  Things do
happen to men sometimes, and their religion don't make
any more difference then to what they do than the hat
on their heads.  Quite right, too.  I like to think there's
a bit of metal in you.  Sometimes I almost wish you'd
make me feel it, when I startle you and say my silly
speeches."
</p>

<p>
"How can I be angry with such speeches as yours?
They'm silly enough only too often; but they'm frank as
light.  'Tis the hidden and secret thing I'd rage against."
</p>

<p>
"If you found it out."
</p>

<p>
"I should find it out.  There's no power of hiding in
you, even if there was the will."
</p>

<p>
"You'm a dear man," she said, and lifted her mouth
and kissed him.
</p>

<p>
"All the same," she added, "every woman's got a power
of hiding&mdash;even the biggest fool amongst 'em&mdash;and&mdash;and
the old gravestones of they lost people be quite as
interesting to me as the crosses are to you."
</p>

<p>
"I don't say they are lost.  I only say that we've no
right to say anything about all them as went down to death
before salvation came."
</p>

<p>
"Why couldn't Jesus Christ have hastened into the
world quicker?" she asked.  "'Twould have saved a deal
of sad doubt about all them poor souls."
</p>

<p>
"You ought not to think such questions.  I lay Woodrow
said that."
</p>

<p>
"No, he didn't.  'Tis my very own thought.  Suppose,
Dan, that He'd been the earliest man born of a woman,
and comed into the world Eve's first li'l one?  How would
that plan have worked?"
</p>

<p>
He stared at her.
</p>

<p>
"Who could have crucified Him?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
She sighed.
</p>

<p>
"I forgot that."
</p>

<p>
"It shows how ill-regulated your mind is, Sarah Jane.
You oughtn't to let your ideas run so wild."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis no fault of yours that they do.  And yet your fault
it is, I do believe, Dan, for you keep me so terrible close
to holy thoughts."
</p>

<p>
"The closer the better through the time that's coming.
To think you could picture my boots stamping life out of a
fellow-creature!  'Twasn't a kind fancy, to say no more of
it.  As much as to say I might be no better than a wild
beast, given the temptation."
</p>

<p>
"All men are beasts when the wind blows from somewhere,"
she said.  "Let a certain thing but happen, and
they'll be as hot and stubborn and hard and fierce as the
animals.  Some would never forgive being robbed; some
would never forgive being laughed at; some would never
forgive being deceived by another person.  Everybody's
got one spot like that.  Some will go mad for a woman;
some for a thing.  Why did Agg quarrel with Lethbridge
and knock him off his feet into the stream last week?  Such
an easy, lazy man as Agg to do it!"
</p>

<p>
"Because Lethbridge said that Agg would get a girl at
Mary Tavy into trouble before he'd done with her.  'Twas
an insult, and Agg was quite right to knock him down.
'Twas no fault in him."
</p>

<p>
She did not answer.  Then he spoke again.
</p>

<p>
"Don't think I don't know my faults.  I know 'em
well enough.  The gospel light shows them up very clear.
But jealousy ban't a fault, and I never will allow it is.
'Tis a virtue, and every self-respecting married Christian
ought to be jealous.  I'm jealous of the whole world that
comes near you.  I'm jealous of every male eye I catch
upon your face&mdash;at church or anywhere.  'Tis my nature
so to be.  A man that marries hands over to his wife the
best he's got, and 'tis just as precious to a day labourer as
to a crowned king.  He does well to be jealous of it.  He'd
be a mean-minded fashion of creature if he wasn't."
</p>

<p>
"I don't feel like that," she replied.  "You've said
yourself that nought can hurt a man from the outside; so
how can a wife hurt a man?"
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord! what a lot you've got to learn, Sarah Jane!
To talk of a wife as being outside!  Ban't she the
innermost of all&mdash;a man's own self&mdash;next to his God?
'Outside'!  I wouldn't like for anybody else to hear you say
a man's wife is outside him&mdash;and you a wife yourself."
</p>

<p>
"I'm rested," she said.  "Us'll go on.  I wish I was
so deep-minded as you, but I never shall be.  A regular Old
Testament man you are."
</p>

<p>
"'Tisn't deep-mindedness," he answered; "'tis religious-mindedness.
The puzzle to me is that you, who be so good
as gold and honest as light, ain't more religious-minded.
John Prout's the same.  I know he's all wrong, yet I can't
get up and point out where he's all wrong.  'Tis what he
leaves undone that's wrong."
</p>

<p>
"It takes all sorts to make a world."
</p>

<p>
"But only one sort to make heaven," he answered very
earnestly.
</p>

<p>
"Lucky we are not called upon to decide what sort."
</p>

<p>
He laughed rather grimly.
</p>

<p>
"You an' Prout would let all through, if you had to
judge," he said.
</p>

<p>
They reached the peat-works presently, and found Mr. Friend
awaiting them.  Sarah Jane praised him for putting
on his Sunday coat, but she expressed greater dissatisfaction
than ever at seeing the place he called home.  For Gregory
had been true to his word, and left Dunnagoat cot after
Sarah Jane's marriage.
</p>

<p>
Now he dwelt at the scene of his futile work, and only
left it once or twice a week to gather his supplies.  He had
taken a chamber in the ruin, boarded the floor, built up a
wall in the midst, removed his grate and oven from Dunnagoat,
and established himself, much to his satisfaction, in
the very midst of the skeleton of the peat-works.  There he
dwelt perfectly happy and content.  No anchorite ever chose
a spot more lonely and desolate for a home; but a repellent
condition usually absent from the hermit's cell belonged to
Mr. Friend's abode.  Here were no surroundings of a
natural grot, no ivy curtain at the door, no matin song of
birds to rouse the recluse.  Instead scowled rotting roofs,
broken walls, rusting metal and a sullen spirit of failure.
The very perspective of the tram-lines, stretching straight
into the midst of the ruins, by some accidental stroke upon
the mind through the eye, added another mournful character
to this scene.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Friend greeted them cheerfully.  Tea was made, and
chairs were set about his little table.  His daughter protested
with all her might at the miserable conditions in which he
now chose to dwell.
</p>

<p>
"Look at the damp on the walls!  Ban't a place for a
dog to live in, let alone a man.  Dunnagoat was
weather-proof, anyway."
</p>

<p>
"'Twill serve very well.  There's a talk of something
definite come the spring.  So like as not we shall set to
work again afore another year's gone; and I must be on
the spot.  I be going to see if I can get steam in the boiler
this week.  But I almost doubt it.  Then there's an order
for Plymouth will fetch best part of a five pound note."
</p>

<p>
"Us have brought 'e a bit of news," announced Dan;
"but Sarah Jane's set on telling you herself."
</p>

<p>
"Guess, father," she said.
</p>

<p>
"That Dan's got advancement.  'Twas time he had too."
</p>

<p>
Brendon shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I wish you was right," he answered.  "But you're
not.  It don't look as if I was ever to be raised.  However,
farmer may see it presently."
</p>

<p>
"He does see it," declared Sarah Jane.  "He's sharp
as a needle behind his quiet, casual way.  He knows what
you're good for.  Who is it he seeks if any thing's to be
done?  Who is it gets the difficult work, where brains
be wanted to a thing?  'Twill come right, only us can't
hurry it."
</p>

<p>
Brendon laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I shall get advancement the same time that you'll set
your peat-works going again, and not sooner, father," he
told Gregory.
</p>

<p>
"I hope so.  They be both things delayed; but both be
bound to happen sooner or later.  You'm like Amicombe
Hill&mdash;good all through, Dan.  The time will come when
other people will be sorry enough they didn't find it out
sooner."
</p>

<p>
They discussed the various problems of Daniel Brendon
and Amicombe Hill for some time.  Both men were sanguine,
and both wondered why other people so obstinately
failed to see with their eyes.  Daniel put his faith in God
and declared that he felt no fear of the ultimate issue; but
Mr. Friend inclined to trust man.  It was idle to suppose
that the results of his personal investigations on Amicombe
Hill peat would be ignored for ever.  He believed that some
sagacious spirit must presently arise at headquarters, justify
his patient belief, and delve for the treasure that he still so
zealously guarded.
</p>

<p>
Presently Gregory turned to his daughter.
</p>

<p>
"And what's the secret only you are to tell me, my
dear?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I be going to have a little baby," said Sarah Jane.
</p>

<p>
"A big one more like!  And a boy I do hope.  That's
capital news, and I wish you both joy of him with all my
heart.  If 'tis a boy, call him 'Amicombe' for luck&mdash;eh?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no!  He shall be called 'Gregory' after his
grandfather," declared Daniel.
</p>

<p>
The news cheered Mr. Friend, and he became very
solicitous for Sarah Jane.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you let her do too much work," he said.  "She
mustn't tramp up here no more.  I'll come down of a
Sunday instead."
</p>

<p>
But his daughter laughed.
</p>

<p>
"You old dear!  I shall call you a grandmother instead
of a grandfather."
</p>

<p>
"I can see him running about here taking his first lessons
in peat, an' messing his little self up to the eyes in it,"
said Mr. Friend.  "An' right welcome he'll be.  There's
many wonders up here as I'll show him."
</p>

<p>
"Might be a girl, however," said Daniel.
</p>

<p>
"I hope not and I think not," declared the peat-master.
"'Twill be a brave boy, I'm pretty sure.  Us may be doing
a roaring business before he appears; but be that as 'twill,
I'll always make time to play a game with him.  When's he
coming, Sarah?"
</p>

<p>
"In September, I reckon."
</p>

<p>
"A very good time.  Well, well&mdash;what would your
mother think!"
</p>

<p>
"She knows all about it, be very sure," said Daniel.
"And now us must get going, for the dusk be down
a'ready."
</p>

<p>
"I'll come to you next Sunday," promised Gregory, as
he bade them "good-bye," after walking part of their road
with them.  "And there's four sacks more of my special
fuel for you when you can draw them, Dan.  You must
keep her so warm as a toast through the spring weather,
and 'if you want heat, burn Amicombe peat,' as I made up
twenty years ago."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a rhyme that will never be forgot," said his son-in-law;
and Gregory, well pleased at the compliment, kissed
Sarah Jane, then left them and returned to his den.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
AWAKENING OF WOODROW
</h3>

<p>
Daniel Brendon had long since stopped the meetings of
his master and his wife at dawn, when Sarah Jane milked
the cows.  He was naturally a jealous man, but in this
matter emotion took an elevated form.  No earthly consideration
tainted it.  His only concern was for Sarah Jane's
soul.  To let her come within the breath of infidelity, from
Daniel's standpoint, seemed deliberate sin.  His God was a
jealous God, and, as he himself declared, he held jealousy,
in certain aspects, a passion proper to healthy man.
Therefore he had desired his wife not to speak with Hilary
Woodrow more than she could help, for her soul's sake; and she
had obeyed him, and avoided the master as far as she
might without rudeness.  Yet her heart felt sorrow for
Woodrow.  She perceived the wide want in his life and
explained it more correctly than could her husband or any
other man.
</p>

<p>
On the Sunday after their visit to the peat-works, Daniel
took Sarah Jane to Mary Tavy instead of to Lydford.  They
went to chapel with Agg; and the service pleased Brendon
well.  He had debated as to the propriety of praying in a
place of dissent, but Agg spoke highly of his minister, and
induced the other to accompany him.  The incident served
powerfully to affect Brendon's future, for this service,
largely devoid of the familiar formulæ of his own church,
impressed him with its life and reality.  The people were
attentive, their pastor was earnest and of a warm and loving
heart.  A few got up and spoke as the sitting extended;
and presently, to the amazement of Sarah Jane, her
husband rose and uttered some words.  He rehearsed a text
from Isaiah, proclaimed it to be his favourite book in the
Bible, declared that it covered all things and was tremendous
alike in its threats and promises.  For three minutes he
stood up, and his great voice woke echoes in the little,
naked, white-washed meeting-house.  When he knelt down
again there followed a gentle hum of satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
From that day forward Brendon threw in his lot with
the Luke Gospellers and made Sarah Jane do the like.
</p>

<p>
Agg congratulated him very heartily as they returned
home, and Daniel explained that to have acted thus was far
from his thought when he started.
</p>

<p>
"Something pulled me on to my feet and made me
speak.  'Twas a force, like a strong voice, whispering in
my ear.  I oped Isaiah at hazard&mdash;my Bible always falls
open there&mdash;and them words fell under my eye, and I had to
speak."
</p>

<p>
"You'd make a very valiant hand at it with a bit of
practice," declared Agg, "and the deaf would come miles
for to hear you.  Your voice be like a big drum."
</p>

<p>
"There was a bird sat up on the rafters," said Sarah
Jane.  "The poor thing had flown in, an' couldn't find
the window.  It sat so still as a mouse through the sarvice,
till Dan spoke.  Then the rafter shook, I suppose, for
it flew about, and drove against the window with its little
wings."
</p>

<p>
"I'm mazed to look back and think that I've actually
stood afore my fellow-men and spoke to 'em from God,"
said Daniel.  "To do such a thing never entered into my
mind."
</p>

<p>
"'Twas a terrible brave deed," declared Sarah Jane.
"But I ban't surprised; there's nothing you can't do, if
you think 'tis right to do it."
</p>

<p>
That night Agg took Brendon again to chapel; but the
wife stayed at home.
</p>

<p>
It happened that Hilary was returning from a long ride
after the hour of dusk, and as he came up through his fields
he met Sarah Jane alone.  She had walked to meet Daniel,
who would presently be returning with Agg from the evening
service at Mary Tavy.
</p>

<p>
The farmer stopped, and when she prepared to go on her
way, bade her wait for a few moments.
</p>

<p>
"I'm in luck," he said.  "I wanted to speak to you,
Sarah Jane, and here's the chance.  Where are you off to at
this hour?"
</p>

<p>
"Going to meet Dan.  Him and Agg have gone to
worship with the Luke Gospellers down-along."
</p>

<p>
"You astonish me.  Such a pillar of the church as
Brendon to seek some new thing!"
</p>

<p>
"We went this morning, and Daniel was terrible pleased,
and liked the homely feeling of it.  They'm kind folk, and
Mr. Matherson, the minister, speaks and prays beautiful."
</p>

<p>
Woodrow had often mentioned serious subjects to this
woman without perceiving the futility of such a course.  But
he did so more for the pleasure of hearing his own ideas,
than from any wish to influence her.  There was none to
heed his opinions, none with whom to exchange thoughts
and arguments touching the topics that so largely
interested him.  At first, therefore, he had regarded Sarah
Jane as a useful listener, and enjoyed talking to her for the
sake of talking.  Then her own attitude attracted him, and
he spoke less and listened more.  Her views arrested his
mind a little.  She was uneducated, yet nature had actually
led her to some ideas that he had only reached through the
channel of books.  Once or twice, in her blunt speech and
with her scanty vocabulary, she uttered a thing that wise
men had only found by taking thought.  Her natural mind
drew Woodrow; then the lovely body of her interested
him, and she began to fill his attention.
</p>

<p>
Women had almost passed out of his life after one of
them jilted him; now this particular woman reminded him
that they were not all alike.  His eyes opened; it struck him
that he was deliberately depriving himself of a great part
of the joy of life by ignoring them.  His thoughts began to
play upon the subject, and his memory revived events of
the past.
</p>

<p>
Whether it was Sarah Jane's sex, or Sarah Jane's self
that had awakened him, remained to be seen.  He told
himself, despite his admiration for her spirit and her beauty,
that it could not be the individual who had aroused dormant
sense, but rather the accidental fact of having been thrown
into contact with her.  The world was full of women.  He
pondered the problem, and now, by light of moon, told
Brendon's wife of a decision at which he had recently
arrived.
</p>

<p>
"A great one for the Bible, my Dan," said she.  "Miles
of texts he've got by heart.  A regular word-warrior he is."
</p>

<p>
"If he believes it, he's right to stick to it.  Why, if I
believed 'twas the Word of God&mdash;actually the very thoughts
of the Almighty sent by Him&mdash;I'd never open any other
book, Sarah Jane.  I'd think that every second of my
reading time spent with man's writings was a wasted
moment.  If I had faith&mdash;it would move mountains."
</p>

<p>
"That might be my Dan speaking.  But you know pretty
near so many verses as him, for all you don't believe in
'em."
</p>

<p>
"We free thinkers are much keener students of the Bible
than thousands who profess to live by it."
</p>

<p>
"And yet you reckon there's no God and not another
life after we die?"
</p>

<p>
"My old grandfather had a saying, 'When a man's dead,
there's no more to be said.'  That was his philosophy, and
though my father called him a godless heathen, yet I always
agreed with the old man, though I wouldn't have dared
to say so.  But mind this, Sarah Jane&mdash;this I will grant:
if there's another world after death, then there's a God.
You won't have one without the other.  Nature can look
after this world; but it will take a God to look after the
next.  Don't think I believe there's another.  I'd scorn to
believe anything that nature doesn't teach me.  But, none
the less, it may come true; and if it does, that means God."
</p>

<p>
"This life's mighty interesting," she said.  "To me 'tis
full to the brim; but Dan says the only drop in the cup
that matters is the sure thought of the Kingdom of Heaven
after."'
</p>

<p>
"Trust to this life.  That's a certainty, at any rate.
Look after this life, and the next will look after itself."
</p>

<p>
"Funny you should say that.  Dan's way's just different.
He says, 'Look after the next life, and this one will
look after itself'!"
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense&mdash;I'm right.  And you know I'm right."
</p>

<p>
Sarah Jane felt in a mind to tell him that she was with
child.  As yet only her husband and her father knew it.
She was about to do so, when he spoke again.
</p>

<p>
"I shall not live to be an old man," he said.  "I know,
as well as I know anything, that the longest half of my
days are done.  I thought the best of them were done too.
But you've made life very interesting again and well worth
living."
</p>

<p>
"You shouldn't say things like that, I'm sure, though
I'm very glad you like me, Mr. Woodrow.  What's amiss
with you?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing&mdash;everything."
</p>

<p>
"Your cough's better, so Mr. Prout says.  I wish you'd
find a wife, sir.  That might be the best physic for you."
</p>

<p>
He did not answer immediately.  The moon came from
behind a cloud, and Sarah Jane strained her eyes into the
distance.
</p>

<p>
"Dan ought to be coming," she said.
</p>

<p>
"A wife?" he asked suddenly.  "Perhaps if I could
find another Sarah Jane&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"My stars! what a thought!  Poor company for 'e&mdash;the
likes of me!"
</p>

<p>
"I've never seen such another, all the same."
</p>

<p>
She laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Well, why for don't you look round?"
</p>

<p>
He stood still and did not reply.
</p>

<p>
"My! how bright the moon be this evening," she said.
"There they are&mdash;Daniel and Walter Agg.  I see 'em long
ways off.":
</p>

<p>
"Do you know that the moon was alive once?" he asked.
"She was a mother; and now she's only a grave for all
the things she bore.  She's our picture, too&mdash;the skeleton at
the world's feast of life.  It will be just the same here,
Sarah Jane&mdash;cold&mdash;dead&mdash;the earth and moon going round
together&mdash;like two corpses dancing at a dying fire."
</p>

<p>
"What dreadful things you know!"
</p>

<p>
"Life's only conjuring with dust.  I suppose we shall
never find out how 'tis done.  But there are clever chaps in
the audience always jumping up and saying 'That's it!  I
see the trick!'  Only they don't.  Each new book I get
hold of gives the lie to the last.  There's nothing true that
I can see.  Like a boy chasing a butterfly: down comes his
hat after a long run.  But the butterfly's in the air."
</p>

<p>
"Proper place for it."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps so.  A butterfly pinned into a case is only half
the truth of a butterfly.  Words in a book can never be more
than half the truth of ideas.  But I'm sick of reading.  I'm
sick of everything&mdash;but you.  Don't be frightened.  You
said just now I ought to go and look about.  Well, I'm
going.  I'm going to London for a while, and then down to
Kent to a cousin of mine&mdash;a hop-grower there."
</p>

<p>
"The change will do you a world of good."
</p>

<p>
"That's doubtful.  I shan't be very contented out of
sight of Dartmoor.  Perhaps if I can't see Great Links for
a while, I shall value it all the more when I come back."
</p>

<p>
"And do, for pity's sake, bring a wife with 'e."
</p>

<p>
Daniel Brendon and Agg approached, and Hilary spoke to
them as they arrived.
</p>

<p>
"I'm telling Mrs. Brendon that I mean to take a holiday,
Dan.  Going to look at London again.  'Twill make me
long to be back home pretty quick, if it does nothing else."
</p>

<p>
"You might buy one of them new mowing machines
against the hay-harvest, if you be up there, master,"
suggested Agg; but Daniel did not speak.  He had returned
from chapel in a spirit very amiable, and to find Sarah Jane
under the moonlight with Woodrow instantly changed his
mood.
</p>

<p>
They parted immediately, and Brendon spoke to Sarah
Jane as they entered their home.
</p>

<p>
"What be you doing, walking about with the man after
dark?"
</p>

<p>
"I was afraid you might be vexed.  We met quite by
chance as I came to seek you, and he stopped, and would
be talking.  He said he ban't going to be a long-lived man,
and I told him he wants a wife; and then he said if he could
get another like me he might think of it."
</p>

<p>
"Be damned to him!" said Brendon violently.  "I
can't stand no more of this.  I won't have this talking
between you.  'Tisn't right or seemly, and you ought to
know it, if you're a sane woman."
</p>

<p>
"He's never said one syllable to me you couldn't hear,"
she answered, believing herself, but forgetting a word or
two.  "All the same, I'll avoid him more, Daniel, when
he comes back.  He may fetch along a wife with him.  But
don't you be angered, dear heart.  I'd rather up and away
from Ruddyford at cocklight to-morrow for evermore, than
you should frown.  'Tis silly to be jealous of the sun for
throwing my shadow, or the wind for buffeting me."
</p>

<p>
"I am jealous.  I'm a raging fire where you be concerned,
and always shall be&mdash;for your soul first.  I won't
insult you to speak of any other thing.  Any other thing's
not speakable.  You know I'm built so, and you don't strive
to lessen it, but just the contrary.  I wish you was more
religious-minded and more alive to the sacredness of the
married state."
</p>

<p>
"I'm myself, Dan&mdash;for good or bad."
</p>

<p>
The man was gloomy for some days after this scene, and
Sarah Jane went her way with patience and unfailing good
humour.  She felt no anger with him on her side.  She
understood him a little; but jealousy was a condition of
mind so profoundly foreign to her own nature, that her
imagination quite failed to fathom its significance and its
swift power of growth in congenial soil.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Hilary Woodrow kept his word, and presently left home
for an indefinite period.  He told himself that he was going
away to escape temptation; in reality he went to seek it.
His object was simple: to learn whether the arrival of
Brendon's wife at Ruddyford had merely awakened his old
interest in women generally, or whether it was she herself,
and only she, who had roused him out of a long sexual
apathy.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br><br>
IN COMMITTEE
</h3>

<p>
Hilary Woodrow's departure from Ruddyford made no
difference to the course of events.  Routine work progressed
according to the prescribed custom of Dartmoor husbandry.
Oats were sown during the last week of March; potatoes
followed; then the seed of mangold went to ground, and
lastly, in June, with the swedes, this protracted planting
of crops ended.
</p>

<p>
There came a night when John Prout found himself too
weary to keep an appointment at Lydford.  Therefore he
asked Daniel to go instead.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis the business of the water-leat," he explained.
"The water's coming in autumn some time, and now
Churchward and the rest are going to set about things again
in earnest.  The committee sits at the schoolroom this
evening."
</p>

<p>
Brendon, however, doubted.
</p>

<p>
"I can't just go and say I've come to take your place,"
he answered.  "The rest might not want me on the
committee."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, they will," declared Prout.  "You'll do a lot
better than me.  You'm younger and have your ideas.  'Tis
about the procession and so on.  A lot was done last time;
but 'tis such a while agone, that I dare say they'll have to
begin all over again.  Anyway, I couldn't ride to Lydford
to-night for a fortune.  I'm dog tired."
</p>

<p>
"'Twill fit very well," said Sarah Jane, who was clearing
away the tea-things in Ruddyford kitchen.  "I walk into
Lydford myself this evening, to take the butter to
Mrs. Weekes.  Say you'll go, Daniel."
</p>

<p>
"I'm willing enough.  The only point is if I can serve
on a committee in place of another man."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly you can," said Mr. Prout.  "They'll be
very pleased to see you, I'm sure.  Jarratt Weekes is a
member, and he'll take you along with him."
</p>

<p>
"I'll go, then," assented Daniel, "and Weekes will post
me up in the business, no doubt."
</p>

<p>
It happened that relations of a harmonious character
existed at present between the family of Philip Weekes and
Ruddyford.  Hephzibah took large quantities of Sarah Jane's
butter into Plymouth every Saturday; and sometimes Philip
himself, or the girl Susan, came for this produce.
Occasionally it was brought to Lydford by a messenger from the
farm.  The Brendons were now on terms of friendship with
Jarratt's parents and of superficial friendship with the
castle-keeper himself.
</p>

<p>
To-night Sarah Jane and Daniel heard the familiar voice
raised as they entered the front gate, and, despite a loud
summons, they stood some while under the dusk, with the
scent of the garden primroses in their nostrils, before any
attention was paid to them.
</p>

<p>
Then Susan appeared, and as she opened the door the
full and withering blast of Hephzibah's rhetoric burst upon
the air.
</p>

<p>
"Didn't hear 'e first time," said the girl.  "Aunt's in
one of her tantrums.  A very awkward thing's happed just
now.  Awkward for Uncle Philip, I mean.  He was in the
street talking to Mr. Churchward; and unbeknownst to him,
on our side the wall, not two yards off, Aunt Hepsy chanced
for to be."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind all that," interrupted Sarah Jane.  "Here's
the butter, and my husband be come to see Jarratt.  We
don't want to hear none of your rows, Susie."
</p>

<p>
"You'll have to hear&mdash;you know what Aunt Hepsy be."
</p>

<p>
They went into the kitchen, and Mrs. Weekes, without
saluting them, instantly turned the torrent of her speech in
their direction.
</p>

<p>
Philip sat by the fire with his hands in his pockets and
his wistful grey eyes roaming, rather like a wild animal
caught in a trap; his son was eating at the table;
Mrs. Weekes stood in the middle of the kitchen; her legs were
planted somewhat apart, and her arms waved like semaphores
to accentuate her speech.
</p>

<p>
"Your eyes be enough," she said.  "You cast 'em to
the ceiling, an' search the floor an' the fire with 'em; but
you can't hide the guilt in 'em&mdash;you evil-speaking traitor!
He'd have me dead&mdash;what d'you think of that, Sarah Jane?
As a wife you can understand, perhaps.  Every word I
caught when I was in the garden&mdash;doing his work, of course,
and picking the lettuces that he'd ought to have picked and
washed and packed two hours afore.  An' him t'other side
of the wall telling to that wind-bag that teaches the
children&mdash;though what he does teach 'em except to use long, silly
words, I can't say.  'The sooner she's dead the better!'  That
was the thing my husband spoke&mdash;in a murdering voice
he spoke it.  And my knees curdled away under me&mdash;the
Lord's my judge!  I could almost hear him sharpening a
knife to do it!  'The sooner she's dead the better.'  That
was what he said.  Murder, I call it&mdash;black murder; and
he'll hang in the next world for it, if he don't in this.
Wished me dead!  Knave&mdash;foul-minded rascal!&mdash;beastly
coward to kill the wife of his bosom with a word!  And
now&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The familiar gasp for which her husband waited came,
and he spoke before she could resume.
</p>

<p>
"I'll only say this.  I was speaking of Adam Churchward's
old collie bitch&mdash;may I be stuck fast on to this settle
for evermore if I wasn't; and when I said 'sooner she's
dead the better,' 'twas in answer to schoolmaster's question.
If I was struck dumb this instant moment, that's the truth."
</p>

<p>
"Truth&mdash;you grey and godless lump of horror!  Truth&mdash;who
be you to talk of truth?  After this the very word
'truth' did ought to rust your tongue black and choke you!
Not a word of that will I believe.  'Twas me you meant;
an' when I heard it, I tell you the sky went round like a
wheel.  I catched hold of a clothes-post to stop myself from
falling in a heap.  And now if cherubims in a flaming, fiery
chariot come down for me from heaven, I wouldn't go.
Nothing would take me&mdash;I'd defy death for my indignation!
I'll see you out yet, you wife-murderer, you vagabond, you
cut-throat dog of a man&mdash;ess fay, I'll see you out if I've got
to wait twenty thousand years to do it!'
</p>

<p>
"Here," said Jarratt Weekes to Daniel Brendon, "me
and you will get from this.  When she lets go, you might as
well try to put in a word with a hurricane as with her."
</p>

<p>
"All the same, it was Churchward's old worn-out dog,
as he'll testify to," said Philip.  "The creature's suffering,
and she'll be killed to-morrow morn; an' that's evidence for
anybody who's got a level mind and no grudge against me.
Be it sense or reason that I'd say a thing like that to a
neighbour&mdash;even if I thought it?"
</p>

<p>
"How you can sit there with your owl's eyes
a-glaring&mdash;&mdash;" began Mrs. Weekes&mdash;then Daniel followed
Jarratt.
</p>

<p>
"I'll come back along for you presently," he said to
Sarah Jane.  "You stop here till we're home from the
committee."
</p>

<p>
A moment later he explained his purpose, and Weekes
raised no objection.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a silly business altogether," he said.  "I so good
as swore I'd not join 'em again myself; but if the thing's
to be, 'tis well there should be a little sense among these
foolish old men.  You can take Prout's place and welcome.
Churchward will try to talk Latin about it when he hears,
and pull a long face, and say 'tis irregular or some rot.  But
if I tell him I wish it, he'll cave in.  Last meeting was at
his home; but we turned the room into a public-house bar
before we'd done with it, and so his daughter won't let us
assemble there again.  Quite right too."
</p>

<p>
"A very fine woman she is&mdash;so Sarah Jane tells me."
</p>

<p>
"She is&mdash;and plenty of sense.  In fact&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Jarratt broke off and changed the subject; but Daniel,
without tact, returned to it.
</p>

<p>
"I hope we'll all soon be wishing you joy in that matter."
</p>

<p>
Weekes made no answer at all.  The thought was bitter
to him that this common man, who had beaten him and won
Sarah Jane, could thus easily approach him as an equal and
congratulate him on his minor achievement.  He hated
anything to remind him of the past, and disliked to think
that the fact of his rumoured engagement to Mary Churchward
had reached the Brendons' ears.  This girl was a promising
wife enough; but she fell far short of Sarah Jane
in beauty and strength and melody of voice.
</p>

<p>
"There's the schoolroom&mdash;the hour was seven-thirty, so
we'm a thought late," said Jarratt Weekes.
</p>

<p>
They entered to find the rest of the committee assembled.
Mr. Churchward, Mr. Spry, Mr. Huggins, Mr. Norseman,
Mr. Pearn and Mr. Taverner&mdash;all were there.
</p>

<p>
Weekes explained that Daniel Brendon had come to represent
John Prout, and suggested that the rest should fall
in with this alteration.  Some questions arose whether it
could be permitted, and the schoolmaster instantly fulfilled
Jarratt's prophecy by doubting if Daniel might stand for
Prout&mdash;<i>in propria persona</i>.
</p>

<p>
Nathaniel Spry was referred to, but would express no
definite opinion; then Weekes spoke again, inviting the
committee to use its common sense, if it had any, and asked
what earthly difference it could make to the upshot whether
one farming man or another joined their deliberations.
</p>

<p>
"Me an' Mr. Prout think alike in some ways&mdash;not in
all," explained Brendon.  "As to such a matter as a revel,
when the water's brought into Lydford, we might be of one
mind.  But I warn you, please, that in matters of religion
we're different."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right, then," declared Noah Pearn, the
publican, "for this hasn't nothing to do with religion&mdash;any
more than my free lunch have."
</p>

<p>
"All the same I'll be party to nothing that can hurt
religion, and well the committee knows it," declared
Mr. Norseman.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you shout till you're hurt," said Weekes.
"We're not heathen, I believe.  I propose that Mr. Brendon
takes Prout's place on the committee, and I ask you to
second, schoolmaster."
</p>

<p>
None raised any further objection.  Daniel took his place
and Mr. Churchward turned to Nathaniel Spry.
</p>

<p>
"Read the minutes of the last meeting," he said.
</p>

<p>
The postmaster rose rather nervously and shuffled his
papers.
</p>

<p>
"Keep it short as you can, Spry.  We wasted a lot of
time over that meeting&mdash;don't want to be here all night,"
remarked Jacob Taverner.
</p>

<p>
"I can't be 'urried, Jacob," answered the other.  "I'm
secretary, and I've done the work in a very secretarial way,
and it's got to be read&mdash;all of it&mdash;hasn't it, Mr. Churchward?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly it has," answered the schoolmaster.  "In
these cases the minutes of previous assemblies have to be
kept carefully, including all memoranda and data.  There is
a right way and a wrong way, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Get on!" interrupted Weekes.  "If Spry have to
read out all that mess and row we had at the first
meeting&mdash;sooner he's about it the better."
</p>

<p>
Nathaniel Spry rose and wiped his glasses.
</p>

<p>
"Go under the lamp, postmaster," said Brendon.
"You'll see better."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," answered the secretary.  "Much obliged
to you.  I will do so."
</p>

<p>
"One thing," suddenly remarked Noah Pearn.  "I want
to ax whether among the characters in the show we might
have Judge Jeffreys.  I seed his name in an old book awhile
ago, and 'tis clear he held his court to Lydford castle.  Shall
he walk with the procession?"
</p>

<p>
"We can go into that later.  We <i>must</i> read the minutes
first.  Otherwise everything is <i>ultra vires</i> and illegal,"
declared Mr. Churchward.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Spry can set it at rest in a minute by saying who
Judge Jeffreys was&mdash;that is if he knows," suggested
Mr. Taverner.
</p>

<p>
"We all know that," declared Mr. Norseman.  "He was
a regular historical Lydford character."
</p>

<p>
"Would he do to walk, Spry, or wouldn't he?  Answer
in a word.  If he's no good&mdash;we need say no more."
</p>

<p>
"Order!" cried Mr. Churchward.  "I call everybody to
order who interferes with Spry.  We must have the minutes!"
</p>

<p>
"You ought to know about Judge Jeffreys yourself,"
said Weekes shortly.  "You're a schoolmaster, and should
have the whole history of the man at your finger-ends."
</p>

<p>
"And so I have," declared Mr. Churchward.  "Of
course I have.  Who doubts it?"
</p>

<p>
"Then let's hear it.  Ban't for the chairman to deny
information to the committee," said Mr. Pearn.
</p>

<p>
Adam shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"I bow to your opinions, though it's very unbusinesslike
and improper."
</p>

<p>
Then he turned to Spry and spoke with resignation.
</p>

<p>
"Tell them about Judge Jeffreys, Nathaniel&mdash;since they
insist upon knowing.  If you make any mistake, I'll correct
you."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Spry dropped his report hopelessly, took off his
glasses and scratched his head over the right ear.
</p>

<p>
"He wasn't a very nice man, if my memory serves me,
gentlemen.  A thought 'asty and a thought 'arsh.  There's
poetry written about him.  He did his work in the time of
Charles I., or it might be Charles II."
</p>

<p>
"Or the Commonwealth," interrupted Mr. Churchward.
</p>

<p>
"Very true&mdash;very true, 'or the Commonwealth,' as you
say, schoolmaster.  He was rather what is called a hanging
judge.  Still, his red robes and flowing wig would be a great
addition to the scene."
</p>

<p>
"Let the man walk!" cried Mr. Huggins.  "A solemn
judge would be so good as a sermon to all the young youths
for miles around, and show 'em what wickedness might
bring 'em to at any moment."
</p>

<p>
"You don't mean that, Mr. Huggins," explained
Brendon, who knew the veteran. "You mean&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We all know what he means," declared Mr. Taverner.
"Well, you propose Jeffreys and I'll second it, Noah."
</p>

<p>
"In due course&mdash;in due course.  The judge shall pass
committee in his proper turn," said Mr. Churchward.
"Now, Spry, read as quickly as you can, but nothing's to
be missed."
</p>

<p>
"How long is the report?" asked Henry Norseman.
</p>

<p>
"Twenty-four pages of foolscap and a half," answered
the secretary.  "I've written it all out twice, and it filled
my spare time for three weeks doing it."
</p>

<p>
"Let's take the thing as read!" suggested Mr. Taverner.
</p>

<p>
But Nathaniel objected indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all!" he said.  "I won't have that.  I appeal
to the chair&mdash;three weeks' work&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't want to have any words with you, postmaster;
but all the same, without feeling, as a member of this
committee, I propose we take the minutes as read,"
answered Taverner firmly.
</p>

<p>
"Who'll second that?" asked Weekes.
</p>

<p>
"I will," said Noah Pearn.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Churchward sighed, shook his head tragically, and
put his hand over his brow.
</p>

<p>
"I do wish, Jacob Taverner, you would bend to the law
of committees and listen to the chair," he begged.  "Don't
you understand me?  I'm pretty good at making myself
clear, I believe&mdash;it's my business to do so to the youthful
mind&mdash;and I tell yuu it can't be done.  Legally everything
we enact before the minutes are read is nothing at all&mdash;a
mere <i>lapsus lingua</i>, in fact."
</p>

<p>
"Besides," said Daniel, "I beg to say I ought to hear
the minutes&mdash;else how can I know what was settled at the
first meeting?"
</p>

<p>
"You're soon answered," replied Jarratt Weekes.
"Nothing was settled at the first meeting."
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon, Jarratt," said Adam Churchward.
"That is neither kind nor true.  A great deal was settled&mdash;else
how would it take Nathaniel Spry twenty-four and a
half pages of foolscap to put it all down?  And no man
writes a better or neater hand.  Therefore I ask you to call
back that statement."
</p>

<p>
"There was a lot said&mdash;I admit.  But surely you must
allow there was mighty little done," retorted Weekes.
</p>

<p>
"The question is whether the minutes are to be taken
as read.  I've proposed that and Pearn's seconded it,"
repeated Mr. Taverner.
</p>

<p>
"And I rule it out of order, Taverner, so there's an end
of that," answered Adam.
</p>

<p>
"The question is if you can rule it out of order," replied
Jacob Taverner.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly he can.  Bless the man, he's done it!" said
Brendon.
</p>

<p>
"He says he's done it; but if it's not legal, he can't
do it.  Everybody's got a right to speak on a committee,
and I never heard in all my born days that a chairman
could rule a thing out of order, if 'twas properly proposed
and seconded," answered the other.
</p>

<p>
Much irrelevant but heated argument followed, and
none could satisfy Jacob that the chair was in the
right.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the landlord of the Castle Inn turned to
Valentine Huggins.
</p>

<p>
"Let's abide by you, Val," he cried.  "You'm the oldest
among us.  I warrant Taverner will abide by you.  What
do you say?"
</p>

<p>
"I say 'beer,'" piped the ancient man.  "I be so dry
as a dead bone along o' listening; what you talking members
must be, I can't picture."
</p>

<p>
"I second," declared Weekes; "and 'tis idle for you
to pretend that can't be passed, Churchward, because we're
unanimous&mdash;except Norseman, who'll have his bottle of
lemonade as per usual, no doubt."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Pearn had already put on his hat.
</p>

<p>
"I'll nip round myself an' tell 'em to send it in," he
declared.  Then he hurried off.
</p>

<p>
"I'm in your hands, of course," began the schoolmaster.
"I merely remark that I don't pay again.  If
you had listened to the minutes, you'd have been reminded
that the chairman stood liquor and tobacco last time.  We
must give and take&mdash;even in committee."
</p>

<p>
"I'll pay half," said Mr. Taverner.
</p>

<p>
"And I'll pay the rest," declared Nathaniel Spry,&mdash;"provided
the committee will keep quiet and let me read
the minutes while it's drinking."
</p>

<p>
"That's fair enough, certainly," said Brendon.  "By
the looks of it, this meeting won't have no time to do more
than hear what fell out at the last.  'Tis near nine o'clock
now, and us no forwarder."
</p>

<p>
When Mr. Pearn returned with a pot-boy and three quarts
of ale, the secretary had started upon his report.  Nobody
paid much attention to him save Daniel Brendon; but as
soon as the liquor was poured out&mdash;by which time Mr. Spry
had come to St. George and the Dragon&mdash;an interruption
took place.
</p>

<p>
"I ask for that passage to be given again," said
Mr. Norseman.  "I heard my name, but I didn't catch what
went with it."
</p>

<p>
Nathaniel read as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Valentine Huggins then proposed that the Dragon
should go along with St. George, and it was suggested that
Mr. William Churchward should enact the Dragon.
Mr. Norseman then said that he would be party to no
play-acting, because play-acting in his opinion was wickedness;
and he added that if the committee persisted in this opinion,
he would think it his duty to put the matter before the
vicar.  Mr. William Churchward was privately approached
by the chairman subsequent to the meeting and refused to
play Dragon&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If that's still your opinion, Norseman, you'd better go
off the committee," said Mr. Taverner; "because to dress
up to be somebody else is play-acting in a way, even though
nought's said.  You be in a minority of one, so you may
just as well retire."
</p>

<p>
"I may be, or I may not be," answered Mr. Norseman.
"I'm here to do my duty to the best of my power, and, in
a word, I shan't retire."
</p>

<p>
"I don't hold with play-acting either," declared Daniel
suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"Ban't sure that I do, on second thoughts," added
Mr. Huggins.  "Anyway, I want to say that if any other
member would like to be Moses&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"That's all settled and passed, and you can't withdraw,
Valentine," replied Mr. Churchward.  "Go on, Nat."
</p>

<p>
"What is play-acting and what isn't?" asked Mr. Pearn.
"We'd better settle that once for all.  I say 'tisn't
play-acting if no speeches are made."
</p>

<p>
"If it has been carried that Mr. Huggins is to be dressed
up as Moses, I'm afraid I must vote against it," said Daniel.
"I'm very sorry to do anything contrary to the general
wish, but I couldn't support that.  In my view 'tis playing
the fool with a holy character."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be so narrow-minded," said Mr. Taverner.
</p>

<p>
"You must be narrow-minded if you want to keep in the
narrow way," declared Norseman.  "The man's right,
though I haven't seen him in church for three months."
</p>

<p>
"If we're going back on what we passed last time&mdash;'tis
idle for you to read any more, postmaster," said
Mr. Churchward.  "I may remind the committee that
Mr. Norseman himself had no objection to Moses before."
</p>

<p>
"More shame to me," answered the churchwarden
frankly.  "I was weak, as them in a minority too often
find themselves; but now, with this man beside me, I'm
strong, and I stand out against Moses tooth and nail."
</p>

<p>
"Let's drop Moses, souls!" said Mr. Huggins.  "We
can walk very well without him, and we don't want to offend
church or chapel, I'm sure.  'Twould be a bad come-along-of-it
if we had vicar and the quality against us.  If I can
give him up, I'm sure all you men ought to."
</p>

<p>
Jarratt Weekes had been turning over the pages of Mr. Spry's
report while the rest talked.  Now he suddenly rose
to his feet and shouted loudly:
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Spry&mdash;what's this you've got here?  Like
your insolence&mdash;making me look a fool in the eyes of the
committee!  This stuff shan't be read&mdash;not officially.
You've put words here that I spoke in heat.  Not that they
wasn't perfectly reasonable ones&mdash;all the same, they
shouldn't be recorded.  I'm not going to be written down,
in cold blood, as using swear words.  'Tisn't fair to
anybody's character.  Here it is, neighbours, and I ask you if
'tis right&mdash;page twenty-one&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He read as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'The chairman then quoted the Latin language, which
annoyed Mr. Jarratt Weekes, who thereupon asked him,
why the hell he couldn't talk English."
</p>

<p>
"You oughtn't to have put that down, Nathaniel," said
Mr. Churchward reproachfully.  "It would far better have
become you to leave that out.  If I could forgive it&mdash;which
I did do&mdash;surely&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"There it is for anybody to see," continued Weekes;
"and I propose we burn his silly minutes, for they'm
nothing but a tissue of twaddle and impertinence and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I rise to order!" cried Mr. Spry.  "I'm not going
to be insulted to my face and stand it.  I claim the
protection of the chair and the committee in general.  What
right had I to doctor the report?  If people use foul
language on a committee and lose their tempers and
misbehave themselves at a public function, let 'em take the
consequences!"
</p>

<p>
"You shut your mouth!" shouted Weekes, "or I'll
make you.  A pink-eyed rabbit of a man like you to stab
me in the back with your pen and ink!  I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Order&mdash;order!" cried Pearn and Taverner simultaneously.
Everybody began to talk at once, and Brendon
turned to the chairman.
</p>

<p>
"Why the mischief don't you keep order?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Easy to say&mdash;easy to say," answered Adam wildly.
"But what mortal man's going to do it?"
</p>

<p>
"'Twas you broke up the last meeting, Weekes, an' I
don't think none the better of you for it," grumbled
Mr. Huggins.  "All the same us shan't get through no business
now&mdash;an' the beer be all drunk and the time's past ten&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I propose we adjourn," said Mr. Norseman.
</p>

<p>
"And so do I," added Brendon.  "Never knowed myself
that a lot of growed-up men could make such a row and be
so foolish."
</p>

<p>
"The meeting is suspended <i>sine die</i>, gentlemen,"
declared Adam Churchward, "and I may add that I'll not be
chairman again.  No&mdash;I will not.  The strain is far too
severe for a sensitive man."
</p>

<p>
"Just like you," answered Weekes.  "The moment you
get into a mess, you curl up, same as a frightened woodlouse.
You're not the proper man for a chairman."
</p>

<p>
"And you're not the proper man for a committee,"
answered Adam, very pink and hot.  "'Tis all your fault, and
I say it out, notwithstanding the&mdash;the relations in which
we stand.  You've not the self-control for a committee.  And
you do swear a great deal too much&mdash;both in public and
private life."
</p>

<p>
They wrangled on while Norseman and Brendon departed,
and Spry only stayed to see his report scattered on the floor
under everybody's feet.  Then, with an expression of opinion
unusually strong for him, he took his hat and went home.
Mr. Pearn looked after the crockery, Mr. Taverner assisted
Valentine Huggins into his coat and saw him on his way.
</p>

<p>
"Out of evil cometh good, Jacob," said the ancient.
"Be it as 'twill, I've got Moses off my back.  But this
here have furnished a dreadful lesson to me not to push
myself forward into the public eye.  Never again will I
seek to be uplifted in company.  'Twas only the sudden
valour of beer made me offer myself, and I've never had a
easy moment since."
</p>

<p>
Elsewhere Mr. Churchward and Jarratt quickly settled
their difference.  Indeed, as soon as Spry had departed, the
chairman adopted an attitude very disloyal to the postmaster,
and even called him an officious little whippersnapper.
This appeased the injured Weekes, and when his
future father-in-law went further and invited him home to
see Mary and drink some whisky, Jarratt relented.
</p>

<p>
"Us'll drop this business once for all," he said.  "It
don't become your position to sit over a lot of silly fools
that don't know their own mind.  You've got something
better to do with your time, I'm sure.  When I'm married to
Mary, you shall help me with figures and suchlike.  Anyway,
don't you call them ignorant men together again.  I
won't have it.  Let the water come and be damned to it.
'Tis nothing to make a fuss about when all's said."
</p>

<p>
"You may be right," admitted Mr. Churchward.  "In
Christian charity the committee meant well, but they have
not been educated.  There's no logic&mdash;nothing to work upon.
I'm disappointed, for I had spent a good deal of thought
upon the subject.  However, if it's got to fall
through&mdash;there's an end of it."
</p>

<p>
And Brendon, as he tramped home with Sarah Jane,
made her laugh long and loud while he told of the meeting.
He was not much amused himself&mdash;only somewhat indignant
at the waste of hours represented by that evening's work.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br><br>
ADVENT
</h3>

<p>
Gregory Daniel Brendon was born on the first day of
October, and work nearly stood still at Ruddyford until the
doctor had driven off and the great event belonged to
past time.  Nothing could have been more splendidly
successful than his arrival, or himself.  There was only one
opinion concerning him, and when in due course the child
came to be baptized, he enjoyed a wide and generous measure
of admiration.
</p>

<p>
Hephzibah, who was nothing if not superlative, attended
the christening, and, after that ceremony, proclaimed her
opinion of the infant.  Sarah Jane, whose habit of mind led
her to admire Mrs. Weekes, had asked Philip's wife to be
godmother, and such a very unusual compliment awakened
a great fire of enthusiasm in the sharp-tongued woman's
heart.
</p>

<p>
After a Sunday ceremony, according to the rite of the
Luke Gospellers, all walked on foot back to Ruddyford, and
Mrs. Weekes, with Sarah Jane upon one side of her and
Susan, carrying the baby, on the other, improved the hour.
</p>

<p>
"Only yesterday, to market, Mrs. Swain said 'My dear
Hephzibah'&mdash;so she always calls me&mdash;'why, you'm not
yourself&mdash;you'm all a-dreaming!  I ax for a brace of fowls,'
she says, 'and, merciful goodness,' she says, 'you hand me
a pat of butter!'  'Twas true.  My mind ran so upon this
here child, as we've marked wi' the Sign to-day.  I tell you,
Sarah Jane, that, cautious as I am in my use of words, I
can't speak too well of him.  He's a regular right down
masterpiece of a child.  Look at his little round barrel, if
you don't believe me.  An' a hand as will grasp hold that
tight!  An' a clever child, I warn 'e.  Did 'e mark the eyes
of un when he seed parson's gold watch-chain?  He knowed!
'Twas his first sight of gold&mdash;yet up his fingers went to i'
an' he pulled a very sour face when he had to let go.  There's
wisdom there&mdash;mark me.  And hair like a good angel's.
True 'tis only the first crop an' he'll moult it; but you
can always take a line through the first what the lasting
hair will be.  Curly, I warrant, an' something darker than
yours, but brighter than his father's."
</p>

<p>
"He've got his father's eyes to a miracle," said Sarah
Jane.
</p>

<p>
"He'm listening to every word you be saying!" declared
Susan.
</p>

<p>
"A precious, darling, li'l, plump, sweet, tibby lamb!"
cried Mrs. Weekes in an ecstasy.  "Hold off his blanket,
Susie.  Yes, if he ban't taking it all in.  A wonder and a
delight, you mark me, mother.  You've done very clever
indeed, and never have I seen such a perfect perfection of a
baby, since my own son Jarratt was born.  Just such
another he was&mdash;a thought more stuggy in the limbs,
perhaps, as was natural with such round parents; but noways
different else.  Would fasten on a bit of bright metal like a
dog on a bone."
</p>

<p>
"My little one's got lovelier eyes, if I may say
so&mdash;lovelier eyes than Jarratt's," said Sarah Jane.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a matter of opinion.  Some likes blue, some brown,
some grey.  Eyes be same as hosses: you can't have good
ones a bad colour.  Taking it all round, grey eyes see more
than brown ones, and little eyes more than big ones.  But
long sight or short, us can all see our way to glory.  This
here infant's marked for goodness.  Mind you let him use my
spoon so soon as ever he can.  'Tis real silver, Sarah Jane,
as the lion on the handle will tell 'e, if you understand such
things."
</p>

<p>
"I knowed that well enough the moment I saw it, and
so did Tabitha.  'Tis a very beautiful spoon indeed.  He's
had it in his mouth a'ready, for that matter."
</p>

<p>
"Trust him!&mdash;a wonder as he is!  There ban't nothing
he won't know the use for very soon.  That child will be
talking sense in twelve months!  I know it!  I'm never
wrong in such matters.  A lusty tyrant for 'e; an' a great
drinker, I warrant!"
</p>

<p>
"A grand thirsty boy for sartain," admitted the mother.
"An' my bosom's always brimming for his dear, li'l, red
lips, thank God!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Weekes nodded appreciatively.
</p>

<p>
"You've got to think of his dairy for the present.  Who
be looking after Ruddyford's?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, I be," said Sarah Jane.  "I was only away
from work five weeks."
</p>

<p>
"When do Mr. Woodrow come back?"
</p>

<p>
"Afore Christmas, 'tis said; and that reminds me: Mr. Prout
wants a tell with your son.  There's something in
the wind, though what it is I can't say."
</p>

<p>
"I'll carry the message.  I see Prout chattering to
Weekes behind us now; but 'twill be better he gives me any
message that's got money to it.  When Philip Weekes says
he'll bear a thing in mind, 'tis a still-birth every time, for
nothing's ever delivered alive from his addled brain.  That
poor man!  But 'tis Sunday and a day of grace.  However,
I'll speak to Prout.  Susan&mdash;what&mdash;here, give me over the
child this instant moment.  You hold un as if he was a doll,
instead of an immortal Christian spirit, to be an angel come
his turn.  An' that's more'n ever you can hope to be, you
tousled, good-for-nought!"
</p>

<p>
Joe Tapson and Walter Agg joined the women.
</p>

<p>
"These be the two men gossips," said Sarah Jane.  "I
wanted for Mr. Prout to be one, but Daniel mistrusted his
opinions.  Dan's very particular indeed about religion, you
must know."
</p>

<p>
"Quite right too," said Mrs. Weekes.  "And I hope as
you men will keep that in mind and never say a crooked
word or do a crooked thing afore this infant hero.  He's a
better built boy than either of you ever was, without a
doubt, and you can see&mdash;by the make of his head-bones&mdash;that
he'll be a master one day and raised up above common
men&mdash;just like my own son be.  But never you dare to lead
him astray, or I'll know the reason why.  I'm his god-mother,
and I don't take on a job of this sort without being
wide awake.  An' if there's any faults show in him
presently, I'll have a crow to pluck with you men very quick."
</p>

<p>
"What about his father, ma'am?" asked Agg.
</p>

<p>
"I'll say the same to him as I say to you," she replied.
"I'll stand no nonsense from his father.  The child's worth
ten of his father a'ready.  Lord! the noble weight of him!
Here, take hold of him, Sarah Jane, for the love of heaven.
He's pulling my arms out of the arm-holes!"
</p>

<p>
At the rear of the party walked together the father and
grandfather of the baby.
</p>

<p>
Daniel had talked about his child until he felt somewhat
weary of the subject.  But nothing could tire Gregory
Friend.  Already he planned the infant's first visit to the
peat-works, and every time that his son-in-law changed the
subject, he returned to it.
</p>

<p>
Daniel laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you'll have two things to talk about now," he
said.  "Afore 'twas only peat&mdash;now 'twill be peat an' the
baby."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered Gregory, "you'm quite right there,
Daniel.  I'll larn him all I know, and I dare say, if he's
spared, he'll find out more than I know.  But my secrets
that child shall have in course of time&mdash;if he proves worthy
of 'em."
</p>

<p>
John Prout and Philip Weekes walked together and
discussed another subject.
</p>

<p>
"He's coming home presently," said the head man of
Ruddyford, "but the doctors reckon he'll be wise to stop
off the high ground and winter in the valleys.  His idea be
to put up at Lydford for the winter, and he's divided between
taking a couple of rooms at the Castle Inn, with Noah
Pearn, or renting a house if he can get one.  He'd rather
have the house for peace and quietness.  But 'tisn't often a
house worth calling one be in the market to Lydford.  Now
I'm thinking of your son's place&mdash;what he bought
back-along from widow Routleigh before she died."
</p>

<p>
"Might suit Jar very well, I should think," said the
other.  "'Tis true he's going to be married to the
schoolmaster's daughter; but they'm not in any hurry.  In fact,
there's more business than pleasure to the match, I fancy,
though I wouldn't dare to say so.  Anyway, the cottage is
empty now.  'Twould want doing up.  'Tis the very house
for a tender man&mdash;sheltered from north and east and west,
wi' a face that catches every glimmer of sun that shines."
</p>

<p>
"I'll name it to master in writing.  I'm sadly troubled
about it all.  I suppose you don't know what your son
would ax?"
</p>

<p>
"Can't tell you that.  The more Mr. Woodrow wants
it, the higher Jarratt will rise.  That's business, of course.
I'm not saying nothing in praise of such a way of doing
things, but merely telling you what will happen."
</p>

<p>
"Of course master may prefer Bridgetstowe or Mary
Tavy.  Your son mustn't think there's no competition."
</p>

<p>
"I'll name it to him," said Mr. Weekes.  "By rights
I ought to get a little bit of a commission if it goes through;
but nobody won't think of that."
</p>

<p>
They talked further, and Prout deplored the fact that
Hilary Woodrow's condition had called for a visit to the
doctor.  It was thought he had been exceedingly well and
happy among his friends and relatives in Kent.  Then came
the frosty news of indifferent health.  Philip shared John's
regret, and they still discussed the matter when Ruddyford
was reached.
</p>

<p>
Tabitha had prepared a handsome tea which all attended,
and Gregory Daniel sat on his grandfather's knee and
watched the eating of the christening cake.  A handsome
silver mug quite threw Hephzibah's spoon into the shade.
The gift commanded very general admiration, and Mrs. Weekes,
when appealed to, declared that it could not have
cost a penny less than five pounds.  It came from Hilary
Woodrow.
</p>

<p>
"I'm hoping he'll lift Dan up a bit after he comes back,"
Sarah Jane said privately to Mrs. Weekes, as the tea
progressed.  "My man's worked like a pair of hosses since
master went away; and everybody knows it."
</p>

<p>
"Why for do he stop if he'm not satisfied with his
wages?" asked Hephzibah.  "Such a mighty man he is.
Why, if there was an inch or two more of him, he might
a'most have got his living in a doom-show, an' never done
a stroke more work.  I seed a giant at Plymouth fair two
or three years back&mdash;a poor reed of a man, up seven foot
high, wi' death written in the great, sorrowful white face
of him.  But Dan's so strong as he be large."
</p>

<p>
"He wouldn't fling up Ruddyford for anything.  He gets
very good money, you know, though not so good as he
could wish.  Then there's father up to the peat-works.  I
promised, and Dan promised, not to go very far off from
him."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Weekes shook her head at Gregory Friend, though
he did not appreciate the fact, for he was talking to Philip.
</p>

<p>
"A wilful and a silly soul, though your father," she
said.  "'Tis wasting the years of his life to stop up there&mdash;no
better than a pelican in the wilderness.  He ought to be
made to drop it."
</p>

<p>
"I wish you could make him," said Sarah Jane.  "Already
he's planning to teach the baby all about peat."
</p>

<p>
"'Peat'!" cried Hephzibah scornfully.  "I hope no
godchild of mine will sink to peat.  Let me make a market-man
of him, and take him afore the nation, and teach him
the value of money, and the knack to get it, and the way to
stick to it!"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis very good of you, I'm sure," declared the mother.
"I hope he'll be much drawed to you, come he grows."
</p>

<p>
"He's drawed to me already," asserted Mrs. Weekes.
"We understand each other mighty well."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Going home with her husband, Hephzibah heard the news
concerning Hilary Woodrow and his proposed winter
lodgment.  She was much excited, and even Mr. Weekes won a
word of praise.  But he deserved it, and, in justice, his wife
dispensed the same.
</p>

<p>
When first he told her, she stood still and rated him.
</p>

<p>
"You post&mdash;you stock of a man!&mdash;couldn't you see that
the first thing was Woodrow's address?  Now others will
get to hear tell of this, and then Thorpe will be offering
his dog-kennel of a house at Little Lydford, or them Barkells
at Bridgetstowe will try to get him for that tumble-down
hovel by the church.  Why didn't Prout tell me instead of
you?  If you were a man instead of a mommet,[<a id="chap0208fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0208fn1">1</a>] you'd turn
back this minute and not rest till you'd got farmer's address
for Jarratt.  'Tis taking bread out of your son's mouth if
you don't&mdash;mark me."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0208fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap0208fn1text">1</a>] <i>Mommet</i>, Scarecrow.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"I'll run back an' get it, if you like," said Susan, who
walked beside her aunt.
</p>

<p>
"As a matter of fact, the address is took down in my
pocket-book," explained Mr. Weekes with calm triumph.
"An' more than that: I've got John Prout's faithful promise
not to tell nobody else the address till we've had two
days' start.  That may be the work of a post or a mommet,
or it may not.  For my part, I'm pleased with myself."
</p>

<p>
"Then why ever didn't you say so?" asked Mrs. Weekes.
"'Twas a very proper, smart thing to do, Philip&mdash;and a
very hopeful thing in you.  I always say, and always shall
say, that so far as Almighty God's concerned, He've done
His part in you.  You've got a handsome share of intellects&mdash;in
fact, more than your share, if you wouldn't be so
rash and reckless."
</p>

<p>
"So I say my self," answered the huckster; "and
another thing: I ought to have a bit of commission from
Jarratt, if this goes through.  A lot of these little bits of
business I do for him, off and on, but I never get a
half-crown from the man."
</p>

<p>
"If it goes through, us ought to be thought upon,
certainly," admitted his wife; "but what with his marriage
next year, and that bad debt to Sourton, and one thing and
another, Jar won't be flinging his money about over-free
just now."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br><br>
A HUNGRY MAN
</h3>

<p>
Hilary Woodrow returned home at Christmas.  In the
meantime he had heard from Jarratt Weekes and agreed
to take his cottage at Lydford for an indefinite period.
</p>

<p>
The farmer conversed at length with John Prout, but
told him little respecting his adventures in London, or in
Kent.  His health appeared to be entirely satisfactory, but
Hilary explained that he had received certain medical
warnings.  His lungs were not strong.  His physician did not
object to a winter spent in Devonshire, but advised that the
master of Ruddyford should seek a milder home than the
Moor until spring returned.
</p>

<p>
"In soft weather I shall ride up every day," explained
Woodrow; "but when the frost is heavy, or we're getting
nothing but rain, I shall keep down below."
</p>

<p>
It was arranged that he should go into Jarratt's house
immediately after Christmas, and, to her immense satisfaction,
Susan secured the post of Hilary's servant.  Her aunt
managed this, and duly impressed upon the maiden that
here was the opportunity of a lifetime.  Let her but cook
and order the simple household in a manner to suit
Mr. Woodrow, and her fortune must unquestionably be made,
so Mrs. Weekes assured her; but, on the other hand, if she
failed to satisfy an unexacting bachelor, then her case was
hopeless, and she must never expect to achieve the least
success in service or in life.  To Susan's face Hephzibah
expressed the most fearful doubts; behind her back she
assured the neighbours that her niece was well suited to
the post.
</p>

<p>
"Have I been a-training of her four years for nought?"
she asked.  "A flighty wench, I grant you, and full of
faults as any other young thing, but she can stand to work
and take care of herself very well; and she've always got
me to fall back upon for advice and teaching, seeing I'm
but fifty yards away."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Of Hilary's inner life, while absent from his home, John
Prout naturally heard nothing, and it was a woman, not a
man, who shared the farmer's confidence.  He had striven
to seek escape of mind from Sarah Jane in the society of
other women; and he had failed.  He spent very little time
in London, and found himself glad to quit it again.  His
old enjoyment thereof was dead.  The place offended him,
choked him, bored him.  He had no desire towards any of
its pleasures while there.  Instead, he grew anxious about
his health.
</p>

<p>
In Kent he found himself happier, yet the conditions of
agriculture, rather than any personal relations with kindred,
occupied his days.  The hops gave him much interest.  His
cousins and their friends found him cold and indifferent.
Sarah Jane's image haunted his loneliness, and her picture
in his mind's eye was a lovelier and more tangible thing to
him than the living shapes of the amiable young women he
met.  He had devoted a day to purchasing the silver cup for
Sarah Jane's baby; and on return home he had pleased
Daniel greatly by his attitude towards the infant.
</p>

<p>
"I would have offered to be a godparent," he explained
to Brendon; "but you must take the will for the deed.
With my views I could not have done so, and you would
not have desired it.  Nevertheless, I wish your child every
good.  'Twill be a pleasant thing presently to have a little
one about the place; and it should make us all younger
again."
</p>

<p>
Brendon was gratified, and since his master henceforth
adopted extreme care in his approach to Sarah Jane,
relations proceeded in a manner very satisfactory to all.
</p>

<p>
But fierce fires burnt in both men out of sight.  One's
natural jealousy and suspicion kept him keenly alive to
every shadow on the threshold of his home's honour; the
other knew now with absolute knowledge that Brendon's
wife was the first and greatest thought in his mind.
Passionately he desired her.  He believed that his own life was
not destined to be lengthy, and his interests largely
narrowed to this woman.  Of late ethics wearied him.  He
was impressed with the futility of the eternal theme.  For
a season he sickened of philosophy and self-restraint.  He
found Sarah Jane lovelier, sweeter, more distracting every
way than when he left her.  At Ruddyford no opportunity
offered to see her alone.  Then, as he knew they must
when taking the Lydford cottage, chances began to occur.
</p>

<p>
She often came with the butter for Mrs. Weekes, and
Friday was a fever day for Woodrow, until he saw her pass
his dwelling on the way to the village.
</p>

<p>
Once they spoke at some length together, for he was
riding back to the farm for an hour or two.  The time was
dry and cold.  A powder of snow scattered the ground, but
the air braced, though the grey north spoke of heavier snow
to come.
</p>

<p>
"You never asked me about all my adventures when I
was away, Sarah Jane," he said.  "I had such a number
of things to tell you, but unkind fate seems to make it
impossible for me to talk to the one person in the world I
love to talk to."
</p>

<p>
"What silliness!  I'm sure John Prout's a better listener
than me."
</p>

<p>
"Prout's an old woman&mdash;you're a young one.  That's
the difference.  He bothers over my health as if he was my
mother.  You don't let that trouble you, Sarah Jane?"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed but I do.  'Twas only a bit agone, at your gate,
I was asking Susan if you took your milk regular, and ate
your meat as you should.  And when she said what a poor
feeder you was, I blamed her cooking, and told her I'd
bring a recipe or two from Tabitha, who knows the things
you like.  And I did."
</p>

<p>
"If you're hungry one way, you've no appetite another.
Let me tell you about myself.  We always want to talk of
ourselves when we're miserable, and only care to hear about
other people when we're happy.  I went to seek peace and
I found none.  Nobody comforted me&mdash;nobody knew how
to.  Nobody knew Sarah Jane, and that was the only
subject that could interest me."
</p>

<p>
"Doan't 'e begin that foolishness again.  I had hoped
so much as you might have found a proper maiden to love
you and marry you."
</p>

<p>
"Who can love me?  No, I don't ask that now.  But&mdash;oh,
Sarah Jane, I do ask you to see me sometimes&mdash;only
very seldom&mdash;so that I may hear your voice and look into
your eyes."
</p>

<p>
"Dan&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Is it my fault?  Can you help loving your husband
or your child?  Can I help loving you?  No&mdash;don't look
wild and wretched, as if you thought you were going to be
caught in a thunderstorm.  I do love you, and only you;
and my love for you is the only thing that kept me from
going mad in London.  You can buy sham love there, and
sham diamonds, and sham everything.  Shams are on
sale to suit all purses.  Once, when first I went there, I
enjoyed them&mdash;not now.  There's only one real love and
one real woman in the world now.  But don't be frightened,
Sarah Jane.  The knights of old loved just as I love you&mdash;a
love as sweet and clean and honest, as reason is sweet and
clean and honest.  I only want to make you happier.  The
happier you are, the happier I shall be.  You can't be
angry with me for wanting to make you and yours happy.
You might see me sometimes.  It would be to lengthen my
days if you would."
</p>

<p>
"Daniel&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I guess what you're going to say.  He's not satisfied
with things as they are.  Well, leave that for the moment.
He's safe enough.  Safer and luckier than he knows."
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't thinking of that.  I was thinking what he
would say if he heard you."
</p>

<p>
"Don't tell him.  Never make a man miserable for
nothing.  Another man couldn't understand me.  But a
woman can.  You can, and you do.  You're not angry with
me.  You couldn't be.  You haven't the heart to be angry
with me.  Think what a poor wretch I am.  I saw you
once before you were married.  I actually saw you up at
Dunnagoat cottage.  Saw you and went away and forgot
it!  'Twas a sin to have seen you and forgotten you, Sarah
Jane; but I'm terribly punished."
</p>

<p>
"What wild nonsense you tell whenever you meet me!"
</p>

<p>
"It was after that woman jilted me.  I had no eyes then
for anything or anybody.  I was blind and you were hidden
from me, though I looked into your face."
</p>

<p>
"Enough to make you hate all of us.  She must have
been a bad lot&mdash;also a proper fool."
</p>

<p>
They talked in a desultory manner and he spoke with
great praise of her husband and promised fair things for
the future.  Then he returned to her and strove to be
personal, and she kept him as much as possible to the general
incidents of his visit to Kent.  He told her of the cousins
there, and described them, and explained how they were mere
shadows compared with the reality of her.  He spoke of
the crops, of the orchards, strawberry-beds, osier-beds, and
green hop-bines, whose fruit ripened to golden-green before
the picking.  But to return from the fertile garden to the
stony wilderness was the work of a word; and before she
could prevent it, Daniel's wife found herself again upon
his lips.
</p>

<p>
Under White Hill he left her, and she went straight
homeward, while he made a wide detour and rode into the
farm near two hours later.
</p>

<p>
That day John Prout found his master vigorous and cheerful.
He detailed the fact gladly, and they asked themselves
why it was; but only Sarah Jane guessed, and she did not
enlighten them.
</p>

<p>
She could not, and the necessity for a sort of secrecy
hurt her.  She thought very long and deeply upon the
subject, but saw no answer to Woodrow's arguments.  He had
frankly told her that he loved her; and while her mind
stood still at the shock, he had asked her how it was possible
to blame him for so doing.  He had gone away into the
world that he might seek peace, and he had found none.
Instead, she had filled his sleeping and waking thoughts, and
the mere memory of her had proved strong enough to stand
as a sure shield and barrier between him and all other
women.  His love was an essence as pure and sweet as the
air of the Moor.  He had solemnly sworn it; and she dwelt
on that, for it comforted her.  She retraced other passages of
their conversation, and marked how again and again it
returned to her.  And not only her did he discuss, but her
husband also, and her child, and the future welfare of them
all.
</p>

<p>
She fought with herself and blamed herself for being
uneasy and cast down.  What made her fearful?  Why did
sex move her to suspicion before his frank protestations?
He was a very honest and truth-loving man.  He hated
hypocrisy, and cant, and the letter that killed; he stood for
the spirit that quickened; he longed to see the world wiser,
happier and saner.  Such a fellow-creature was not to be
feared or mistrusted.
</p>

<p>
She told herself that she ought to love him, as he loved
her; and presently she assured herself that she did do so.
He was a gentleman, delicate of speech, earnest, and&mdash;his
eyes were beautiful to her.  She found herself dwelling
upon his outward parts, his gaze, his features, his thin,
brown hands.
</p>

<p>
Prosperity must spring out of Woodrow's regard for
Daniel, otherwise the professed friendship was vain.  She
assured herself of this; then she endeavoured to lift the
problem of her mind into the domain of religion.  Her
husband worked hard to make her religious; now she brought
her difficulties on to that higher plane, and strove to find
more light upon them.
</p>

<p>
Nothing hurt her here.  Religion, as she understood it,
spoke clearly and did not reprove her.  She must love her
neighbour as herself, and seek to let a little of her own
full cup of happiness flow over to brighten the hearts of
those less blessed.  The sole difficulty was in her teacher,
not in her guides.  How would Daniel approve such a large
policy?  She asked him.  But she did not ask him quite
honestly.  She knew it, and she was very unhappy afterwards.
And then she told herself that the end had justified
the means; and then she doubted.  And so the first real
sorrow of her life dawned, became for a season permanent,
and shamed her in her own eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I met Mr. Woodrow to-day, Daniel," she said, "and
walked a bit beside his horse as I came back from Lydford.
I thought once he was going to begin about you, and hoped
to hear the good news that he meant to lift you up at last;
but he didn't actually say it.  Only he asked me to see
him sometimes when I brought in the butter of a
Friday&mdash;just to bring news of Ruddyford."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you do, don't you?  If there's any message,
Prout always sends it by you&mdash;by you, or anybody that
happens to be going in."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; only I generally see Susan, or leave the message
with Hephzibah.  But Mr. Woodrow said he'd like me
to call myself if he was in.  And my first thought was
'no'; then I saw he was so much in earnest, that I said
'yes.'"
</p>

<p>
"You'll do no such thing, and 'twas very bold for him
to ask it, or you to grant."
</p>

<p>
"Of course I won't, if you don't like; but listen a
minute, Daniel.  He was kinder about you than ever I
remember him to be.  'Don't you fear for your husband,' he
said.  'I'm a quiet man, but I'm wide awake.  I know
him.  I know him better than Prout knows him, though
Prout's never tired of praising him.  Leave your husband's
future in my hands.  I mean to make the man in my own
good time.'  That's actually what he said, Dan.  And he
knew very well that I should tell you."
</p>

<p>
Brendon thought awhile.
</p>

<p>
"That's very good news, and a great weight off my
mind," he answered.  "But why did he tell you?  Let
him tell me, if 'tis true.  And that's neither here nor there,
so far as your seeing him goes.  Anyway, I forbid you to
call at his house again."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br><br>
KIT'S STEPS
</h3>

<p>
The inevitable thing happened, and, after numerous
evasions, Sarah Jane consented to meet Hilary Woodrow, that
he might talk to her without restraint or fear of any
eavesdropper.
</p>

<p>
Not until many months had passed did she agree to his
petition; then, on a day when the year again turned to
autumn, they met beside the river at a lonely place known
as Kit's Steps.
</p>

<p>
The farmer had found Jarratt's cottage suit him extremely
well, and, moved by more motives than he declared,
continued to rent it.  For a month only, during high summer,
he returned to Ruddyford; but afterwards, though he rode
over twice or thrice a week to his farm, Hilary dwelt in
Lydford.  Meantime Jarratt Weekes had married Mary
Churchward, and since the master of Ruddyford offered him
a very generous rent for the cottage, Mr. Churchward's
son-in-law, as a man of business, felt not justified in
refusing.  For a further term of a year he let his house, and
by arrangement, lived with the schoolmaster during that
period.  His wife little liked the plan, but was not consulted.
Jarratt, however, promised her that in the following June,
at latest, she should occupy her own dwelling; and with
that undertaking Mary had to be content.
</p>

<p>
Now, on an afternoon of September, Sarah Jane came
to Kit's Steps to pick blackberries and meet Hilary Woodrow.
</p>

<p>
Here Lyd drops through a steep dingle, over a broken
wall of stone; and then, by pools and shallows and many a
little flashing fall, descends with echoing thunder into the
fern-clad gloom of the gorge beneath.
</p>

<p>
At Kit's Steps the river gushes out from a cleft in the
rock, and her waters, springing clear of the barrier, sweep
down in a fan-shaped torrent of foam, all crimped and
glittering, like a woman's hair.  But the waterfall is white as
snow, and, like snow, seems to pile itself upon a deep pool
beneath.  Hence Lyd curls and dances away all streaked
and beaded with light.  Bound about, shaggy brakes of
furze and thorn drop by steep declivities to stream-side, and
the grey crags that tower above are decked with oak and
rowan and ash.  At the cleft whence the stream leaps out,
a curtain of moss hangs down, and great wealth of ferns and
lush green things prosper.  Briars dance in the fall; and
now they spring aloft, as the weight of the water leaves
them, and now are caught by the sparkling torrent and bent
again.  The dark rocks, eternally washed by spray, shine
like black glass; at autumn time the lesser gorses flame;
cushions of heather creep to the edge of the low precipices
and fledge each boulder; while loud upon the ear there
sounds the roar of tumbling Lyd.  It is a place cheerful
in sunshine, solemn at evening or under the darkness of
storm; but always singular and always beautiful.  No
spirit of fear or sorrow haunts it, despite the myth of one
whose griefs were ended here on a day forgotten.

<br>
KIT'S STEPS.
</p>

<p>
Hilary was first at the Steps, and found a sheltered spot
under an oak tree, where mossy stones made an easy couch.
Here impatiently he awaited Sarah Jane; and at length she
appeared with a basket half full of ripe blackberries.
</p>

<p>
At first she was uneasy; but he quickly made her forget
the adventure of the moment, by interesting her mind with
other matters.
</p>

<p>
"You ought to begin by praising me," he said, "for
being so exceedingly good when I was at Ruddyford.  I
only spoke to you thrice all through that long month.  At
what a cost I avoided you, you'll never guess!"
</p>

<p>
"I was the happier that you did.  I thought you was
growing sensible&mdash;about things."
</p>

<p>
"Sarah Jane, there's no sense nor sanity for me away
from you.  I never knew, till I went away to London, what
you were to me.  I said to myself, 'She interested me in
women again, because she's so lovely'; but it wasn't that
at all.  I soon found out you yourself interested me, and
only you.  The light dawned, and first I feared; then I
feared no more.  Now I glory in loving you.  It is far and
away the best thing that's ever happened to me."
</p>

<p>
"Was this what you wanted to say?  It only makes me
miserable&mdash;Hilary."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you for calling me that."
</p>

<p>
"You made me promise to."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't make you.  We can't make our gods do what
we want.  We can only pray to them.  What a curse it
is that we weren't born under a different star, Sarah Jane.
For me, I mean.  If your fearless mind had only been taught
otherwise&mdash;but that's vain to regret now."
</p>

<p>
"Always the same with you&mdash;trying to teach me things
too hard for me, and mix up right and wrong."
</p>

<p>
"But I don't do anything of the sort.  Right is a great
deal to me.  In this matter right and wrong are not the
problem at all.  I'm only mourning custom and
convention&mdash;not the clash of right and wrong."
</p>

<p>
The sexual relation had never occupied this woman's
mind apart from marriage.  Now he made it do so, and
very leisurely, very carefully, explained what he meant by
"custom."  His manner was light and bantering; none the
less, he revealed to her his own deep interest in this
discussion.  He was a special pleader.  He laughed at religious
interference in this connection; told her that it was an
outcome of yesterday; that foreign races shared wives and
husbands; that where life was easy, many men had many
wives; where life was hard, one woman might take several
spouses.
</p>

<p>
"Marriage laws," he said, "have always been a matter
of physical propriety and convenience.  Temperature and
latitude, the food supply, the possibilities of population, and
the dearly bought wisdom of the community, have regulated
it&mdash;not any false nonsense about right and wrong."
</p>

<p>
He told her nothing that was untrue; but everything he
said was an indirect petition, and she knew it.  She was
not shocked at the facts he placed before her; indeed, they
interested her; but she refused to let him influence her own
opinion.  She contrasted Hilary's information with the
fierce and fiery ideas of her husband on the subject.
Between the two her own mind, through forces of education,
inclined to Daniel; yet she saw no great horror in a wider
freedom.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis wonderful how opposite men's thoughts can be,"
she said.  "You and my husband do look at life almost as
differently as the people you be telling about.  'Tis all one
to you, so long as folk do what's good to themselves, without
hurting other folk; but to him&mdash;why, the very name of
evil be evil's self!  Yesternight he was talking to a tramp
who took one of your turnips; and Daniel saw him.  And
he said that, according to Christ, to look over a hedge with
hunger after a root was as bad as pulling and eating it."
</p>

<p>
"Doesn't it scorch you, living with such a narrow
spirit?"
</p>

<p>
"'Twould scorch me to make him unhappy."
</p>

<p>
"That you must never do, Sarah Jane."
</p>

<p>
He began to talk again of the subject in his mind.  But
she begged him to desist.
</p>

<p>
"Leave it," she said.  "What's the sense of telling me
all these curious things about the way people go into
marriage?  Our way is so good as any, surely?"
</p>

<p>
"I only want to enlarge your ideas, and prove my argument:
that there's no right and wrong in the matter, only
the question of fitness and custom.  You're too large-minded
to care a button for peddling quibbles.  But leave it, if you
like.  What you want to do, before all else, is to make your
husband happy; and so do I.  Then we'll talk of that, for
there we quite agree."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," she said.  "'Tis more to me than anything."
</p>

<p>
"And you'll feel a little kind to me for coming to
it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I will.  I always feel kind to you, because I'm
sorry for you."
</p>

<p>
"Then 'tis my turn to thank you; and from my heart
I do.  You know why I'm going to talk of Daniel?"
</p>

<p>
"For honesty, and because he deserves it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;and for love, and because you wish it."
</p>

<p>
"That spoils all, Mr. Woodrow."
</p>

<p>
"Call me Hilary, or I'll not go on.  There's one more
thing you must remember&mdash;in fairness to me.  All good
comes from God&mdash;doesn't it?  Grant Daniel is right about
a God, and you'll grant all good comes from Him."
</p>

<p>
"Why can't you say that good things come out of us
ourselves?  So you have said before to-day."
</p>

<p>
"And so I say again.  But we must think with your
husband's mind over this.  If I lift him up a bit&mdash;what
then?"
</p>

<p>
"He'll thank God for certain."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly.  He'll be the better for advancement&mdash;body
and soul.  He's got a bit peevish of late.  Success will
sweeten him and make him a gentler man."
</p>

<p>
"He feels he's not made enough of at Ruddyford."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I promote him.  I answer his prayers."
</p>

<p>
"And perhaps his God will pay you well.  For Dan's
very likely right."
</p>

<p>
"That's the point&mdash;I'm coming to that.  I expect no
payment&mdash;not from God; because I happen to know that
God is an idea and not a fact.  Therefore&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
He was silent awhile.  Her face changed, and he saw
that she had caught his meaning.  He gave her no time
to dwell upon it then, but plunged into another subject
suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing can happen that is not for good&mdash;if your husband
is right.  Always remember that, Sarah Jane.  God
rules everything and rules everything wisely and perfectly.
Therefore, whatever you do, you are working out His
pattern&mdash;whether you are making the world happier or more
miserable.  Now I'll ask you one question about something
altogether different.  Last Sunday I read the story of David
and Uriah and Uriah's wife.  You know it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, of course."
</p>

<p>
"Have you ever thought about it?"
</p>

<p>
"Only to be terrible sorry for the woman.  'Tis awful to
think what she must have suffered if she loved her husband."
</p>

<p>
"I'm always sorry for Uriah.  'Twas a cruel way out
of the difficulty.  If I had been David I should have lifted
that noble soldier's head high in the world, and studied his
ambitions, and striven to make his life happier."
</p>

<p>
"David knowed the man better maybe.  He reckoned
'twould be safer to put him out of the way&mdash;perhaps even
kinder, too&mdash;if he was such another as my man."
</p>

<p>
"Don't think it.  David had merely to keep Uriah ignorant.
Many things, not the least evil in themselves, only
become so by the revelation of them.  Prevent those who
will think them wrong from hearing of them, and no harm
is done.  I love another man's wife.  Well and good.  Is
that a crime?  Can I help it by an effort of will?  Suppose
that other man's wife is sorry for me, and fond of me too?
Suppose that she finds me interesting, and useful to enlarge
her mind, and helpful to throw light on the difficulties of
life owing to my long years of study?  Is that wrong of
her?  Can she help it?  Can you help it, Sarah Jane?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll never come to you no more, then.  I can help that,
anyway."
</p>

<p>
"No, you can't help even that.  You must come to me
if you love&mdash;Daniel.  I'm his destiny.  I'm the maker of
his future.  His light shall shine, and he shall be a happy
man, and do good and great work in the world long after I'm
dead and gone.  I'm only the poor means, yet vital.  A
stone counts for less than the tool it sharpens; but the steel
couldn't do its work without the stone.  You&mdash;you are your
husband's light, and his life, and his salvation.  You shall
give him his heart's desire if&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He broke off, was silent a moment, then asked a question.
</p>

<p>
"What would Bathsheba have said if David had put it so?"
</p>

<p>
"Depends on the sort she was.  Might was right for
her, poor woman.  She had no choice."
</p>

<p>
"She'd have spoken according to the reality of her love
for Uriah," he said positively.  "She'd have said, 'I am
in the hands of my God, and if good things may come to
my husband through me, 'tis my joy and glory as a loving
wife to take them to him.'  Can God do wrong?"
</p>

<p>
He stopped and looked at her.
</p>

<p>
Her bosom panted and she grew weeping-ripe.
</p>

<p>
"Never&mdash;never, wrong or right.  'Tis cruel to put it so.
He'd rather cut my throat with his own hand.  He'd&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But think&mdash;so much for so little.  I want so little, and
yet not little, for I ask what's worth more than all the
money I've got in the world.  Kiss me&mdash;once, Sarah Jane&mdash;only
once&mdash;and I'll do more for your husband than his
highest dreams or hopes.  For love of him kiss me&mdash;not for
love of me.  Would I ask you to do an evil thing?  Is it
evil to put new life into a very sorrowful man and purify
every drop of blood in an unhappy heart?  Is it evil to make
the sick whole again at a touch?  Didn't Daniel's Lord and
Master do as much a thousand times&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
She stared and turned pale, save for her lips.  Twin
tears glittered in her eyes.  He put his arm round her
swiftly and kissed her.  For the briefest moment he held
her, then he leapt to his feet and drew a great breath.
</p>

<p>
"If I did that often, I, too, should believe in God!" he
said.
</p>

<p>
A moment later he had hurried away, and she sat solitary
and tearful there for nearly an hour.
</p>

<p>
Through intervals of wild uncertainty the things that he
had spoken returned to her memory, and she clutched at
them, like the drowning at straws.  To her husband and his
opinions she also turned.  The outlook of neither man was
admirable to her now.  She sickened at both surveys, and
wished herself a maiden again.
</p>

<p>
Then, with great yearning, she yearned after Daniel, and
rose and hurried off to her home.  Before she reached it
her husband actually met her.  Upon White Hill he came,
with his face to Lydford, and when she stood by his side he
stopped and helped himself from her basket.
</p>

<p>
"Brave berries, sure enough," he said.  "I wish I could
carry 'em back for 'e; but Tommy Bates runned over five
minutes agone with a message from farmer.  He wants to
see me at once, and I mustn't waste a moment.  Can't say
what's in the wind, I'm sure."
</p>

<p>
He went his way, and Sarah Jane returned to Ruddyford.
As she arrived, a little boy came out.  Tommy Bates had
just enjoyed a good tea, and the jam that had smeared his
bread left many traces about his mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Woodrow catched sight of me in the street by
the post-office, an' ordered me to come out-along and tell
Mr. Brendon as he wanted him this very minute," explained
the child.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br><br>
TROUBLE AT AMICOMBE HILL
</h3>

<p>
Tabitha Prout, despite her general contempt of the
married state and those duties that belonged to it, awoke
into a very active love for Mrs. Brendon's baby; and Gregory
Daniel, doubtless appreciating the importance of having
Tabitha upon his side, did all that he could to increase this
regard.  So it came about that when the little boy's
mother was called away, as sometimes happened for a few
hours at a time, the child found a friend in the old maid.
She enjoyed to have the baby beside her at Ruddyford
kitchen, and Daniel foretold that, as soon as the infant
could steer a steady course from his mother's cottage to the
farm, Tabitha would quickly find him a nuisance.
</p>

<p>
Brendon returned from his master in a very happy and
exalted frame of mind.  To Sarah Jane only he imparted
his news; and it was not until nightfall that he did so.
Then he chose the curious form of a prayer for his intelligence,
and while they knelt together and he prayed aloud,
as his custom occasionally was, she heard for the first time,
in her husband's thanksgiving to Heaven, how Hilary
Woodrow had kept his promise.
</p>

<p>
"O Almighty Father, I thank Thee for touching this
man's heart to lift me up and advance my earthly welfare.
And I pray Thee to be on my side always, that I may do
wisely with Thy good gifts and turn more and more to Thee
and trust Thee.  And let me do worthy work and never bate
my mind from thinking how to help Ruddyford and advance
the prosperity of Mr. Woodrow.  I thank Thee humbly,
O God, for all Thy mercies, through Jesus Christ.  Amen."
</p>

<p>
Before she slept he told his wife that Hilary had added
ten shillings a week to his money.
</p>

<p>
"I must go on as I'm going, so he said," explained
Daniel; "but his eyes are opened at last.  I gathered from
him that he quite understood what I am here.  I must give
him time, and all will come right.  It's a lot of money, and
better things in store, I do think.  'Tis the beginning of
great blessings, Sarah Jane."
</p>

<p>
She expressed her delight; but when another morning
came and the man awakened, like a joyful giant, to run his
course, it was not only happiness, but the cloudy pain of a
memory unhappy that dawned in his wife's spirit.  Two
different emotions pressed down upon her heart: remorse at
the thing never to be recalled, and wonder at the price.
The remorse waned and the wonder grew.
</p>

<p>
She mourned and rejoiced and went on with her life, into
which henceforth Hilary Woodrow intruded.
</p>

<p>
Then her abstracted soul was rudely shaken out of itself,
for one day there came running from the Moor a boy with
an evil message.  He had been picking whortleberries near
the peat-works, when a man hailed him, and, approaching
the ruin, he encountered Mr. Friend.
</p>

<p>
"He's cruel bad, seemingly.  In a great heat&mdash;so he
tells me.  I was to let Mrs. Brendon know as he was ill.
He'm short of victuals, and drink, too, and I was to say
as if you could bring up a drop of spirits in a bottle, no
doubt 'twould soon put him right.  And I was to have
sixpence, please, for coming.  He hadn't got any small money
by him for the moment; but he said he'll pay you back
presently."
</p>

<p>
In ten minutes Sarah Jane was hastening over the Moor,
and soon afterwards Daniel, carrying a basket, set out after
her.  He had visited the farm and collected such things as
Tabitha advised.  The man made light of his load, however,
and soon overtook Sarah Jane.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you fret," he said.  "You know what he is.
The wonder is he haven't been struck down a score of times
ere this.  So careless of hisself as a child.  'Tis a bit of a
tissick on the lungs, I reckon.  Us'll soon have him to rights
again."
</p>

<p>
"If he'm bad, I shall bide along with him, Dan.  I can't
leave him here&mdash;not for anything in the world."
</p>

<p>
"Of course not.  I shouldn't ax it.  Very like I'll bide
too.  If we think he's bad enough for a doctor, I'll go off
for one myself."
</p>

<p>
She thanked him gratefully, and they spoke on indifferent
subjects to calm their hearts.  Sarah Jane hesitated not to
praise Hilary Woodrow for his recent action.  Indeed, she
felt they owed him a very real debt of gratitude, and said
so many times.
</p>

<p>
"You're almost too affectionate and kind to everybody,"
her husband declared.  "Pushed so far as you push it, 'tis
weakness."
</p>

<p>
"How can that be, Daniel?  Even you hold it right to
love your neighbour as yourself."
</p>

<p>
"You can strain that into foolishness," he answered.
"And you are prone to do it.  'Tis a sort of gush in you.
You mean nought&mdash;yet there 'tis.  See how you look at a
tramp that comes begging, and how Tabitha Prout looks at
him.  She tells the truth in her eyes, and shows her
contempt of the rascal; you look as if you doted on his lazy
carcase, and would gladly pour out the fat of the larder for
him."
</p>

<p>
"I know 'tis so.  I be fond of my kind&mdash;just because they
be my kind, I think.  I like 'em all&mdash;men, women, childern."
</p>

<p>
"So you should do&mdash;in a general spirit of religion, because
they are made in God's image."
</p>

<p>
"No!" she said vehemently.  "Not that&mdash;not that.
Because they are made in mine!"
</p>

<p>
He showed discontent.
</p>

<p>
"You won't come to see the truth, talk as I may."
</p>

<p>
"Look at the night when you heard our good news," she
answered.  "That shows the difference betwixt us.  You
was thanking God so deep and true, that you hadn't a
thought for Mr. Woodrow.  You was so wrapped up in
heaven that you never seemed to think 'twas a man on
earth&mdash;a creature like yourself&mdash;that had lifted you up.
All the credit went to God Almighty&mdash;all.  Not a drop to
farmer.  Can't us poor human souls have a bit of praise
when our hearts are generous and we do good things?"
</p>

<p>
So she argued in all honesty and out of a passionate
abstract love for her kind.  At that moment she forgot the
circumstances and the nature of the bargain.  She only
begged that her husband should bestow a little of his
gratitude on his earthly master.
</p>

<p>
"As for that, a good human being be only the middle-man
between God and us," he said.  "The Book says all good
comes from Him, and only from Him.  Same as evil comes
from the Prince of Evil into man's heart."
</p>

<p>
"Then what be we but a pack of dancing dolls with them
two&mdash;God an' the Dowl&mdash;fighting for the strings?  Is that
all you'd make of us?  Is that all you'd make of me?  You'll
live to know different, Daniel."
</p>

<p>
"You fly away so," he said.  "Of course there's Free
Will, an' a very great subject 'tis; an' Mr. Matherson be
going to preach upon it next Sunday, I'm glad to say.  So
I hope we'll both win a bit of light when he does."
</p>

<p>
Sarah Jane said no more.  Strange thoughts, not wholly
unhappy, worked in her heart, and she felt frank joy to
think that, though Daniel Brendon had not paid Hilary for
his kindness, somebody had done so.
</p>

<p>
So the husband and wife each failed to grasp the reality
of the other.  While she thus reflected, he was busying
himself with how to earn this handsome increase of salary.  A
dozen plans began to develop in his mind.  Only the inertia
of old routine and custom still opposed his various
enterprises.  But now had dawned a promise of power, and he
was full of hope.
</p>

<p>
They reached the mournful habitation of Gregory Friend
to find him very ill.  He sat by his fire with a couple of
sacks over his shoulders, and complained of great pain in
the lower chest and back, with difficulty of breathing.
</p>

<p>
"It came on two days ago, and I thought I'd throw it
off, as I have many an ache before," he said.  "But it
gained on me.  Then this morning, with light, I began to
wonder what I'd better do, for I felt some deep mischief
had got hold upon me.  I put on my clothes and thought
to try and get down to Ruddyford, as the shortest road to
people.  But by good chance there came a boy picking
hurts, and no doubt he reached you."
</p>

<p>
They spoke together for five minutes.  Then Daniel
started for Bridgetstowe to get a doctor, and Sarah Jane
attended to her father.  She got him out of his clothes and
into bed; she built a big wood fire that set the moisture
glimmering on the walls of Gregory's hovel; she heated
water and made him drink a stiff glass of hot spirits; and
she set about a dish of broth, the ingredients of which
Daniel had brought in the basket.  Mr. Friend revived presently,
but his pain was considerable and he found it difficult
to breathe.
</p>

<p>
"Give me some more brandy," he said.  "It lifts up
the strength.  I did ought to have a plaster put upon my
back without a doubt, for I mind a man up here being took
just like this.  And they put a fiery plaster on him and
drawed the evil out."
</p>

<p>
"There's nought but bread to make it of," said Sarah
Jane.  "Or else peat."
</p>

<p>
His eyes brightened.
</p>

<p>
"That's a good thought&mdash;a capital idea!  Fetch a bit of
the soft and make it red-hot in a saucepan, and 'twill be a
very useful thing&mdash;better than mustard, very like."
</p>

<p>
She did her best, and presently Mr. Friend, with a mass
of hot peat pressed against his side in a piece of Sarah
Jane's flannel petticoat, declared himself much easier.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis life every way," he said.  "This be a great
discovery, and very like, if doctors come to know about it,
'twill go further than all they bird-witted engineers to set
Amicombe Hill up again."
</p>

<p>
He stuck to it that the peat was doing him immense
good.  He drank a little broth when Sarah Jane brought
it to him.  Then he wandered in his speech, and then for
a time he kept silence.
</p>

<p>
"Better for certain&mdash;better for certain now," he said at
intervals.
</p>

<p>
Presently he asked after his grandchild.
</p>

<p>
"Must have him up here a lot next summer when the
weather's good," he said.
</p>

<p>
He seemed easier presently, and his daughter had leisure
to think of herself.  She loved him dearly, and, since
marriage, the gentleness and simplicity of his character had
more impressed her than formerly.  Before, she had no
experience by which to measure his virtues.  Now, with a
larger knowledge of men and life, she could appreciate the
single-hearted Gregory, sympathize with him and perceive
the pathos of his life and futile hope.
</p>

<p>
She talked to him now very openly of her own secret
tribulations and the difficulties of late forced upon her by
her husband's master.
</p>

<p>
"He's lifted Daniel up, father; and Daniel have thanked
God ever since; but&mdash;but 'tis me he ought to thank."
</p>

<p>
Then she proceeded, told her father of the scene at Kit's
Steps, and asked him to help her.
</p>

<p>
"Do nothing to anger Daniel," he said.  "You're playing
with death and worse.  This can't come to good, and I
only hope to God you haven't gone too far already.  That
man Brendon as&mdash;as&mdash;build me up another hot poultice,
will 'e, while I talk?&mdash;Brendon is a lion of the Lord; and
he'd be a lion on his own account if anything happened to
cross him in his den.  Have 'e ever marked his eyes, Sarah
Jane?  But of course you have.  They glow sometimes in
the dimpsy light, like a dog's do glow.  When you see that
in a human's eyes, it means that, down under, there's a
large share of burning fire in 'em.  If Dan thought that he'd
been wronged, not heaven or earth would stand between him
and payment."
</p>

<p>
He began to cough and held his hands to his head.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis like red-hot wires going through the brain," he
said.  "But 'twill be better presently.  I'm in a proper
heat now.  I've been praying to God to fetch out the sweat
on me.  Now the peat have done it."
</p>

<p>
"Don't talk no more, dear father.  Bide quiet a bit an'
try an' see if you can't sleep."
</p>

<p>
"So I will, then; but there's two things I must say first.
One is that you must go away from Ruddyford.  Mark
me, 'tis life or death if the wind's in that quarter and
Woodrow's after you.  He's a desperate sort of man because
he've got nobody to think of but himself&mdash;no family to
consider&mdash;no wife or child&mdash;nothing.  You must go&mdash;go&mdash;far
ways off, where he can't come at you."
</p>

<p>
He stopped, and shut his eyes.  Then, when Sarah Jane
hoped that he slept, her father spoke again.
</p>

<p>
"The other thing is my knife&mdash;the famous one wi' the
ivory handle and long, narrer blade, that I use when I do
my chemical work.  It have a history.  My uncle fetched
it from a foreign land, and it be made of a steel called
Damascus&mdash;the best in the world; and there's gold letters
let into it in a foreign tongue.  'Tis in the works, along with
a few other things, Sarah Jane.  My watch be there&mdash;not
that 'tis any use, for it haven't gone for a year.  Still, if the
worst comes, I'd like little Greg to have 'em from me&mdash;also
the shares in the Company.  He'll live to see them a useful
bit of money.  And the rest must go to you and Dan."
</p>

<p>
"Don't&mdash;don't be talking.  You've got to get well again
quick," she said.  Then she took away his plaster and
brought another hot from the saucepan.
</p>

<p>
"A great invention," he said.  "A great invention.  If
I'm spared, the thing shall be known far and wide afore
long."
</p>

<p>
He dozed between fits of coughing, and moved uneasily
in a semi-dream.  Then came the sound of a galloping
horse, and Sarah hastened to the door.
</p>

<p>
"Can't be doctor yet, unless by happy fortune Dan
ran across him," she said.
</p>

<p>
But it was not the doctor.  The bearded and grave
countenance of Mr. Henry Norseman met Sarah Jane's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Just met Brendon," he explained, "and hearing that
Mr. Friend was in peril, I come up so hard as my hoss
would go, to see if I could comfort him.  I've been light at
more death-beds than one in my time, including my own
father's, and often a word helps the wanderer in the Valley."
</p>

<p>
"He'm not in the Valley, or anywheres near it," answered
the woman stoutly.  "But come in by all means.
If you could bide with him a little, I'll look about, and set
his living chamber in order, and try to make an egg pudding
for him."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Norseman, who knew Gregory and his daughter but
slightly, now dismounted, tethered his horse, and presently
sat by the sufferer; while Sarah Jane, glad of the
opportunity, worked hard to make the dismal hole that was her
father's home a little clean and a little comfortable.
</p>

<p>
"Very kind of you to call, I'm sure," said Mr. Friend,
when his daughter had gone.  "Don't tell her yet, for I
may be wrong; but I'm very much afraid 'tis all up with
me.  'Tis awful deep in me.  I got properly wetted two
days ago, and went to sleep afore the fire."
</p>

<p>
"Where there's life there's hope," said Mr. Norseman.
"But you're wise to face it.  I wish you'd been more of a
church-worshipper, Friend."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well.  I've worked hard and tried to do my duty."
</p>

<p>
"But more goes to life than that.  What are man's days
without faith?  Here you've lived for years, more like a
wild savage of the woods than a devout Christian.  I wish
you'd planned your life wiser, Friend, I do indeed."
</p>

<p>
"So do I.  So do all.  So will yourself, when you'm
down."
</p>

<p>
"As to that, I think I can look forward in hope.  But
you&mdash;you see, you put this life first always.  Your thoughts
ran upon making a fortune out of fuel in this world.  You
never thought about making a fortune in the next, I'm
afraid."
</p>

<p>
Gregory laughed painfully.
</p>

<p>
"Plenty of free fuel where you think I'm going," he said.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Norseman was hurt.
</p>

<p>
"You ought not to jest about a sacred subject&mdash;never&mdash;and
least of all at a time like this," he answered.  "You're
wise to face it&mdash;as we all should&mdash;but not in a ribald spirit.
Don't die with a jest on your lips, Gregory Friend."
</p>

<p>
The other moved and groaned, but with present misery
not in future fear.
</p>

<p>
"For your comfort I can tell you that hell's not what
it was," said Henry Norseman kindly.  "The more understanding
way with respect to it, so parson says, is to believe
that it won't last for ever.  'Tis a noble discovery, if true.
No man was better pleased to hear the sermon he preached
about it than I was.  I can say that honestly.  If hell's
only a matter of centuries and not eternity&mdash;think what an
uplifting thought for a death-bed!  I don't say you're on
your death-bed, Friend, and I hope you're not.  But some
day you will be for certain.  And 'tis a great thought that
the Lord may be found so forgiving that He'll abolish the
place of torment once and for all&mdash;so soon as justice have
been done.  Justice first, of course.  Even you, as can't be
called a church member, or even chapel&mdash;very likely a
thousand years will see you through it&mdash;or less."
</p>

<p>
"God is Love, my mother used to tell," said the sufferer.
</p>

<p>
"And for that reason we have a right to be hopeful,"
declared the churchwarden.  "And I'm for limiting hellfire
heart and soul; though, I warn you, everybody ban't
of the same opinion.  'Tis justice against love weighed in
the balance of the Almighty Mind; and ban't for us worms
to say which will come out top."
</p>

<p>
Sarah Jane returned a little later, and found her father
somewhat agitated.
</p>

<p>
"This man reckons I shan't have more than a thousand
years in hell, if I'm lucky, Sarah," he said.  "'Twas kind
of him to come and lift my thoughts.  And I said that I'd
like to be buried up here 'pon Amicombe Hill, in the peat;
but he reckons 'twould be against high religion."
</p>

<p>
"A most profane wish without a doubt," answered
Mr. Norseman; "and as a Christian man, let alone other
reasons, I shall object to it."
</p>

<p>
Gregory's daughter looked at him, then she turned to her
father.  "Try and eat a little bit of this, dear heart," she
said.  "'Twill strengthen you, I'm sure."
</p>

<p>
A moment later she drew herself up, regarded Mr. Norseman,
and pointed to the entrance with a simple gesture.
</p>

<p>
"And you&mdash;you that could talk of hell to this poor
stricken man, whose good life don't harbour one dark hour&mdash;you,
that can bring your poor church stuff to my father&mdash;I'll
ax you to leave him if you please.  When he dies&mdash;and
may it be far off from him&mdash;he'll go where the large, gentle
hearts go&mdash;to the God that made him and that watches over
the least.  He's done man's work and been faithful.  He's
been loving and kind to all.  Not here, nor in heaven, can
any harsh word be spoke against my dear, dear father."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Norseman pulled his black beard and began to get
annoyed.
</p>

<p>
"This isn't at all the way that Brendon would speak," he
said&mdash;from the door.
</p>

<p>
"No," she answered.  "He's a man, and strong in the
arm.  He wouldn't speak: he'd do.  He'd take you by the
neck and fling you back into Lydford&mdash;and your horse after
you."
</p>

<p>
"You'll be sorry for this disgraceful behaviour," said the
churchwarden.  "'Tisn't a nice way to treat a religious
person who rides four miles out of his way to comfort the
sick."
</p>

<p>
"Rides four mile out of his way to bring hell-fire to a
better man than himself," she retorted hotly; then
Mr. Norseman turned his back and went to his horse.
</p>

<p>
Gregory chid Sarah Jane, but she would not let him talk,
renewed his poultices and strove to make him eat and drink.
He could, however, do neither, and he was wandering in his
speech and partly unconscious before another hour had
passed.
</p>

<p>
Time stretched interminably, and not until the evening of
the day did a medical man arrive on horseback.
</p>

<p>
He had guessed from Daniel's description of the case
what was amiss, and had directed Brendon to bring certain
things to the peat-works as quickly as possible.
</p>

<p>
Sarah Jane watched while the physician made his
examination.  Then he took her into the other room, and
told her that her father was dying.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br><br>
THE HERMIT PASSES
</h3>

<p>
Jarratt Weekes came into his father's home with an
item of news.
</p>

<p>
"That old madman at the peat-works&mdash;Gregory Friend&mdash;is
about done for," he announced.  "I met Brendon
yesterday, running about for a doctor.  I couldn't feel too
sorry myself, and angered him.  'Wouldn't you do as much
for your father-in-law?' he asked me; and I thought of
Adam Churchward, and said I wouldn't."
</p>

<p>
"A man didn't ought to marry his wife's family,"
admitted Mrs. Weekes.  "But you'm too hard without a
doubt.  Well, if Friend be going, there's an end of the peat-works
for evermore.  'Twill be the last breath of life out of
the place."
</p>

<p>
"All the same," said her son, "there's no call for that
long-limbed man to reprove me, as if I was a creature not
made of flesh and blood.  He's so dreadful serious&mdash;can't
see any light play of the mind."
</p>

<p>
"A deadly earnest creature, no doubt," admitted his
mother.  "I wonder if Sarah Jane will be any the better
for Gregory's going?  Probably not.  But come to think of
it, they've had their luck of late.  Her man's getting what
I should call fancy wages myself."
</p>

<p>
"He's worth it," ventured Philip Weekes.  "The things
he does&mdash;Joe Tapson was telling me.  Even Joe, who's a
jealous man, and didn't take at all kindly to Daniel's
rise&mdash;even Joe admits that he's a wonder."
</p>

<p>
"Bah!" said Jarratt.  "He's not half so wonderful as
a three-horse-power steam engine, and can't do half the
work of it."
</p>

<p>
"You're wrong there," answered his father.  "He's got
plenty of brains in his head, and Prout himself has let it
be known that them alterations he begged to be allowed to
make will certainly be for the better, though he stood out
against them at the time."
</p>

<p>
"We're friends now, anyway," continued his son.  "I'm
not saying he's not a very useful man; but I do say, and
always shall, that he wasn't good enough for Sarah Jane."
</p>

<p>
"Us don't want to hear her name no more," declared his
mother&mdash;"not on your lips, that is.  'Tis Mary now, and
she's a proper girl too.  Where she got her wits from I
never can make out.  'Twasn't from her mother, for the
poor soul was only moon to schoolmaster's sun, and hadn't
more sense than, please God, she should have.  That gert,
hulking chap, William, as paints his silly little pictures, be
so like his mother in character as two peas, though he
carries his father's body."
</p>

<p>
"Mary hasn't got no higher opinion of 'em than you
have," declared Jarratt.  "She can suffer her father, but
not the 'Infant.'  She'm twice the man he is."
</p>

<p>
"For my part, I'd sooner do with him than schoolmaster,"
answered Hephzibah.  "Lord save us&mdash;such an
empty drum never was.  Why, to hear his great, important
voice, you'd think he'd met a lion in the path.
Moses&mdash;when he comed down from the Mount&mdash;couldn't have felt
more full of news.  And what do it all come to?  Nothing
at all&mdash;save that he's just drunk a dish of tea round the
corner with some other old fool; or that one of the
school-childer's got the mumps; or some such twaddle."
</p>

<p>
"Not that us should seek to set Mary against her own
father, however," said Philip mildly.
</p>

<p>
"Be quiet, you mouse of a man!" answered his wife.
"Who wants to set children against parents, I should like
to know?  If a child be set against parents, 'tis the silly
parents' own fault&mdash;as you ought to understand&mdash;nobody
better."
</p>

<p>
The family met again that night, and Susan, coming
across from Mr. Woodrow's for some butter, brought the
expected news with her.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Gregory Friend was took off about midday," she
said.  "I met young Billy Luke&mdash;him as he apprenticed to
Mr. Medland, the undertaker.  He knowed all about it.
They be building his coffin this minute, and 'twill be taken
up to-morrow morning; and 'tis ordained that poor Mr. Friend
shall be drove on the trolley that he used to work
up and down the line with his peat."
</p>

<p>
"Quite right," said Mr. Weekes.  "For that matter,
there's no other way they could fetch him down.  Well,
well&mdash;who'd have thought of him going?"
</p>

<p>
"They've allowed Mr. Brendon to have the corpse took
to the vicarage; and the funeral party will walk from there;
and he's to be buried Friday; and two wreaths have come
in already, if you'll believe it," continued Susan.  "One
from them people at High Down, that Mr. Friend did use
to keep in firing free of cost; and one from somebody
unknown."
</p>

<p>
"Us will do the same," declared Philip.  "There should
be some Michaelmas daisies near out, but I haven't looked
at the front garden for a fortnight."
</p>

<p>
"If you had," said Mrs. Weekes, "you'd have found
that owing to your mazed foolishness in leaving the gate
open a while back, Huggins' cow got in, an' the daring
hussy ate our Machaelmas daisies down to the roots afore I
could force her out again.  All the same, we'll do something,
else Sarah Jane won't send us a memorial card; and
I like to see them black-edged cards stuck in the parlour
looking-glass.  They be good for us, and remind us that a
time will come when they'll be printing ours."
</p>

<p>
"Leave that to me," said Philip.  "Not your card&mdash;God
forbid!" he added hastily, "but the wreath.  I thought
well of poor Friend&mdash;very well&mdash;a most hopeful creature.
'Twas only back-along, at his grandchild's christening, that
me and him had a great tell over things in general."
</p>

<p>
"If 'tis a boughten wreath, I'd be wishful to put a
shilling from my savings to it," said Susan.  "I'm terrible
fond of Sarah Jane, and she'll be cruel sad for him."
</p>

<p>
They rolled the morsel of other folks' sorrow upon their
tongues.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Weekes surprised nobody by deciding to attend the
interment.  A funeral was an event she rarely denied herself,
if it was possible to be present.  She found the ceremony
restful and suggestive.
</p>

<p>
"You and me will go, Jar," she said.  "You can't
come, master, because you'll have to be on your rounds
against market-day.  But Jar and me will stand for the
family."
</p>

<p>
"And me," said Susan.  "I can borrow a bit of black
easily from a lot of girls."
</p>

<p>
"I want to go," began Philip.  "I really want to go.  As
a rule funerals ban't all to me they are to you, my dear; but
this is out of the common.  Yes, I must ax of you to let
me go, out of respect to poor Friend."
</p>

<p>
Thereupon Mrs. Weekes took the opportunity and her voice
rose to a familiar and penetrating pitch.
</p>

<p>
"Nought to you if we starve," she began.  "You&mdash;amusing
yourself on Friday of all days&mdash;and the people along
your beat waiting and wondering, and coming down on us
next week for damages; and me going empty-handed to
market Saturday, to be the laughing-stock of Devon and
Cornwall; and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Here Philip, with deprecatory attitudes, withdrew.
</p>

<p>
For once the man stood firm, and having started on his
rounds at dawn upon the burial day of Gregory Friend, he
was able to pay final respect to the peat-master and be
numbered with the mourners.
</p>

<p>
Their company was small, but among them stood one
most unexpected.  Hilary Woodrow had sent a wreath the
night before, and its beauty occasioned comment and
admiration among those who saw it; but that he should come
to the funeral was a great surprise.  Come he did, however,
and attended the opening portion of the service; but he did
not join the party in the churchyard.
</p>

<p>
Brendon waited to see the grave filled; then he returned
to his wife.  She went with her little boy to the house of
Mrs. Weekes after the funeral; and there he presently found
her.
</p>

<p>
Hephzibah insisted on Sarah Jane drinking a glass of
brown sherry, while the child ate a sponge-cake.
</p>

<p>
"Pale sherry-wine be right at a funeral&mdash;not dark," said
the market-woman; "but, at times like this, the right and
wrong of such a small thing really don't count for much
to a sad heart."  Then she turned to Gregory, the child.
</p>

<p>
"You darling boy!  Behaved so beautiful, he did, with
his curls a-shining like gold over his poor little black coat!
'Tis one in ten thousand, as I said from the first.  I could
wish vicar had read the lesson himself, instead of letting
schoolmaster do it.  But Churchward's always turned on to
the lessons nowadays.  'Tis like a bumble-bee reading, to
my ear.  And Farmer Woodrow there too!  Fancy that!"
</p>

<p>
Sarah Jane nodded.  She had suffered very bitter grief
in this loss, but she showed little of it except to her husband.
Only he knew the extent and depth of her sorrow.  He had
asked her not to come to the funeral, but she chose to do
so.  Pale and dry-eyed, Sarah Jane endured.  Of her sorrow
very little appeared.  She lacked her husband's faith, and
strove with poor success to pass the barrier, or see herself
in her father's arms when life's day was done.
</p>

<p>
She drank the wine and brushed the crumbs from her
baby's frock and face.
</p>

<p>
"He wrote Daniel a very beautiful letter&mdash;Mr. Woodrow,
I mean.  He don't think about death like my husband do;
but the letter made even Dan think.  'Twas deep, lovely
language," she said.
</p>

<p>
"He'll be meat for the grave himself if he ban't careful,"
answered Mrs. Weekes.  "A poor, starved frame and
hungry eyes, though there's a wonderful gentlemanly hang
about his clothes.  Something be burning him up in my
opinion&mdash;we all mark it.  Jarratt says 'tis his harmful ideas
about religion; I say 'tis a decline.  I told the man so to
his face last week, when I went over to see Susan; and
he laughed in his gentle way, and said he was all right.
Still, I don't like his look&mdash;more don't John Prout."
</p>

<p>
Sarah Jane listened, but she knew a good deal more
about Hilary Woodrow than any other living creature save
himself.  Little by little there had risen an intimacy between
them&mdash;not of the closest, yet of a sort beyond friendship.
She met him by appointment, now here, now there.  To
this extent she lived a double life, since Brendon heard
nothing of these occasions.  Woodrow talked of going away
for the winter, but she knew that he would never do so.
The days when he did not see her were blank days to him.
He often spoke warmly of Brendon and of the future that
he designed for him.  He longed to make her presents, but
could not.  Now thinking upon almost the last words that
her father had spoken to her, Sarah Jane determined to
throw herself upon Hilary's goodness and honour.  But she
reckoned without his passion.
</p>

<p>
That night, while Brendon slept beside her, she turned
and turned sleepless, with a wet handkerchief rolled up in
her hands.  She mused upon the dear dust in the churchyard,
and the living man beside her, and of that other who
thought waking, and dreamed sleeping, of none but her.
How did she regard him?
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
For a month after her father's death Hilary Woodrow
spared her, and she appreciated his self-denial.  But during
the days he saw her not he revealed a constant and steady
thought for her.  He had continued speech with Daniel,
and Sarah Jane noted that Brendon's enthusiasm for his
master grew as Woodrow's trust in him increased.  Then
she saw Hilary again herself, and his flame leapt the fiercer
for their weeks of separation.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br><br>
BURSTING OF THE SPRINGS
</h3>

<p>
A year passed by and little happened to mark it.  Then
full store of incident fell upon the dwellers at Ruddyford
Farm.
</p>

<p>
It is to be recorded to the credit of Jarratt Weekes that,
in the bitter difference which now happened between him
and Daniel Brendon, he was not altogether at fault.
Nevertheless an underlying element of malignity mingled with his
attitude.  In giving of advice, subtle personal satisfaction often
lurks; yet sometimes the emotion belongs merely to that
implicit sense of superiority felt by the critic over the
criticized.  When Weekes met Brendon on an autumn day
and plunged into the most dangerous subject that he could
have chosen, he did so quite awake to the delicacy; but he
did so from motives at any rate largely blent with good.  He
was now himself happily married, for Mary Churchward,
despite a harsh voice and a hard nature, had plenty of sense,
and proved practical and patient.  Jarratt's feeling to
Brendon and his wife was mainly friendly, and if some
sub-acid of memory still tinged thought, that recollection had
largely faded.  To sum up, if his motives in this encounter
were mingled, he meant no lasting evil, but rather lasting
good from his action.  That Daniel might smart a little he
guessed, and the fact did not cause him any regret.  Frankly,
he was glad of it.  The giving of this advice would lift him
above the lesser man, and, by so doing, help him to win
back a little self-esteem.  As for the upshot of his counsel,
he felt very certain that it must tend to benefit the other
and establish him more securely in his home and its vital
relations.  Since he acted in profound ignorance of Brendon's
own character, his conscience was clear, and his mind free
to state the case with all the force and tact at his command.
He told himself that he was doing his duty; but his deed,
none the less, had a relish that duty usually lacks.
</p>

<p>
Under any circumstances danger must attend the
operation&mdash;how great Weekes did not guess; and in the event,
the added circumstance of Daniel's mood had to be reckoned
with.  This precipitated the catastrophe with terrific
suddenness.
</p>

<p>
When they met, Brendon's dark star was up.  Matters
were contrary at the farm, and a thing, little to be expected,
had happened in the shape of a quarrel between Daniel
and John Prout.  Their master was the subject, and a
word from the younger man brought sharp rebuke upon him.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis all tom-foolery about his being ill," said Daniel.
"He's as tough as any of us.  'Tis laziness that keeps him
mooning about with his books down at Lydford&mdash;that's my
opinion."
</p>

<p>
But Prout flashed out at this, and, for the first time,
the other saw him in anger.
</p>

<p>
"Tom-fool yourself!" he said; "and never you open
your mouth to chide your betters in my hearing again, for I
won't stand it.  You ought to know wiser.  You to speak
against him!  If you had half his patience and half his
brain power, you might presume to do it; but you haven't:
you've got nought but the strength of ten men and a very
unsettled temper to make it dangerous.  I'm sorry for
you&mdash;you that pose for a righteous man and mistrust them as
be set over you.  What do you know about the sufferings
of the body?  When do a cough rack you of nights and
rheumatics gnaw your bones like a hungry dog?  Don't
you dare to say a disrespectful word of Mr. Woodrow again,
for I'll have you away if you do!  After the master he's
been to you&mdash;lifting you above the rest and making you free
of the farm to work where you will, as if 'twas your own.
Dear, dear!&mdash;'tis a bad come-along-of-it, and I'm greatly
disappointed in you, my son."
</p>

<br>
RUDDYFORD.
</p>

<p>
His anger waned towards the end of this speech, as his
words testified; but Brendon, having heard, hesitated and
showed self-control.  He was bitterly hurt at this tremendous
reproof, yet he perceived that it was justified from
Mr. Prout's standpoint.  He did not seek to set himself right.
His first anger died out when John reminded him of the
things that the master had done for him.  He apologized,
but in a half-hearted manner; and then, with darkness of
spirit, betook himself about his business.
</p>

<p>
It was necessary that morning that he should go into
Bridgetstowe, and through a wet autumnal Moor he walked,
passed under Doe Tor, and presently reached the little Lyd,
where she foamed in freshet from the high lands.
</p>

<p>
The springs had burst, and the wilderness was traversed
with a thousand glittering rillets.  In the deep coombs and
wherever a green dimple broke the stony slopes of the hills,
water now leapt and glittered.  Traced to their sources, the
springs might be found beginning in little bubbling cauldrons,
from which, through a mist of dancing sand, they rose out
of the secret heart of the granite.  Then, by winding ways,
they fell, and the green grass marked their unfamiliar
passing with beads of imprisoned light on every blade.  It was
the death-time of heath and furze, the springtime of moss,
lichen and fungus.  Quaint fleshy caps and hoods&mdash;some
white and grey, some amber and orange-tawny&mdash;spattered
the heath; and many mosses fell lustrously in sheets and
shone in pads and cushions.  The great lycopodium spread
green fingers through the herbage, and his little lemon spires
of fruit thrust upward in companies and groups.  Beside
him the eye-bright still blossomed; the whortle's foliage
turned to scarlet; and in the marsh the bog mosses made
splendid mosaic of delicate and tender colours.  At river's
brink the seed-cases of the asphodel burnt, like a scarlet
flame; the sky-coloured bells of the least campanula still
defied death; and the later gentian grew and lifted purple
blossoms from the glimmering grass.
</p>

<p>
Daniel Brendon crossed Lyd by the stepping-stones and
met with Jarratt Weekes.  They walked along together, and
the elder man happened to speak of a matter then in the
other's thoughts.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you know Mr. Woodrow's going at last?
My wife says she can't live with her father no more, and
she's right; so I've had to say that I must have the cottage
empty after Christmas.  What's he going to do?"
</p>

<p>
"Can't tell you," answered the other.  "There's a
general opinion that he's not strong and didn't ought to
spend his winters up here."
</p>

<p>
"I reckon we shouldn't have heard about his health if
he'd been a poor man.  He's well enough to do everything
he wants to do.  Have 'e marked that?"
</p>

<p>
Daniel nodded.
</p>

<p>
"All the same, we mustn't judge people by their looks,"
he said.  "I was thinking much as you do only an hour
agone&mdash;and saying it too.  But I got a pretty sharp rap
over the knuckles from Prout for my pains.  Ban't our
business, after all.  He's a very good master&mdash;never heard
of a better."
</p>

<p>
"And a very good payer.  I've nothing to grumble at.
Only a man's wife must be his first thought.  Mrs. Weekes
wants to go into the house."
</p>

<p>
"Us married ones can afford to laugh at the bachelors,"
declared Daniel.
</p>

<p>
"So us can&mdash;though the bachelors have been known to
pay back the compliment sometimes, and make us a
laughing-stock.  When I was married, kind-hearted people
whispered 'twas the rasp wedding with the nutmeg-grater.
That's the sort of gentlemanly thing one's friends say behind
one's back.  But I think it has been proved different.  My
wife's a wonder in her way&mdash;got all my mother's sense
without her tongue."
</p>

<p>
"You're lucky for certain.  I'm glad Sarah Jane and
her be such good friends."
</p>

<p>
"So am I, and&mdash;and friendship's nothing if it won't&mdash;&mdash;  Look
here, may I say a thing to you on a delicate subject,
Brendon?  Will you promise not to be angered if I do it?"
</p>

<p>
"If you speak of friendship, who can be angered?" asked
Daniel.  "What delicate subject should you have to speak
to me about?"
</p>

<p>
"The tenderest a man can touch to a neighbour.  But
from pure goodwill I speak it.  You'll judge that when you
hear me.  A man doesn't strain friendship and say ticklish
things for fun.  'Tis only out of kind feeling for you and
Sarah Jane that I'm going to say it."
</p>

<p>
"Better leave her out," said Daniel.  "Her welfare's
the same as mine.  She've not got any good away from my
good.  If you do me a friendly turn, you'll be doing the
same to she."
</p>

<p>
"I can't leave her out.  She's the matter."
</p>

<p>
Brendon stopped and stared.
</p>

<p>
"What be you talking about?"
</p>

<p>
"About Sarah Jane.  There it is.  I told you 'twas a
delicate matter.  If you won't stand it, I'll leave it alone."
</p>

<p>
"Go on," said Brendon shortly.  His voice had changed,
and Weekes noticed it.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be angry for nought.  It's a free country, and
I've a right to my opinions, I suppose.  I say again, 'twas
a great act of friendship in me to touch this thing at all;
but if you're going to take it in an evil spirit, I'll stop.  'Tis
no better than the old saying of Lydford Law&mdash;when they
hanged a man first and tried him afterwards&mdash;for you to
speak in that tone of voice, and command me to go on, as
if I was a servant and you the master."
</p>

<p>
"What do you want, then?"
</p>

<p>
"I want you to understand that I'm not doing this
because I like it.  I know the gravity of what I'm going to
say; but I'm not a word-of-mouth friend, but a real
one&mdash;where a man will let me be.  So I say to you that unwise
things are being done&mdash;not by Sarah Jane&mdash;not for a
moment&mdash;but by Hilary Woodrow."
</p>

<p>
"I must ask you to name them."
</p>

<p>
Weekes did not answer immediately.  Then he went to
the heart of the matter, so far as he knew it.
</p>

<p>
"They walk together.  They meet&mdash;accident on her part,
no doubt; but not on his.  Yet could he meet her if he
hadn't fixed to do it?  'Tisn't wrong, of course; but 'tisn't
wise."
</p>

<p>
"You've been watching Sarah Jane?"
</p>

<p>
"Not I.  What is it to me?  They've been seen together
in lonely places, that's all&mdash;no harm, of course&mdash;still&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The other blazed out and his voice rose.
</p>

<p>
"You're a dirty-minded man to say these things to me,
and 'tis far off from friendship that makes you say them!
Quick to think evil&mdash;and wish evil.  To cloud the fair name
of a man's wife&mdash;because she's a fool&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't be a fool yourself!  I'm clouding nobody and
nothing.  I'm only telling you that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Tell me no more!" roared Daniel.
</p>

<p>
"If I did, perhaps you wouldn't make such a silly row,"
answered Jarratt, hot in his turn.  "Why, you great stupid
lout, what is it to me if she's his mistress?  I don't care a
damn&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Brendon cut him short, made a loud, inarticulate sound
like an animal, and struck the smaller man to the earth.
He hit Weekes with his right fist full upon the forehead;
and the blow dropped the castle-keeper backwards, and
deprived him of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
Daniel shouted at the prone figure, raved at him and
cursed him.  Any chance beholder had fled with fear, under
the impression that a maniac rioted there.  The passion-storm
was terrific, and for a time Brendon seemed not
responsible.  Then his wrath gradually passed, and both
the conscious and unconscious men came to their senses.
Weekes recovered, sat up, then stood up unsteadily, and
looked round for his hat and stick.  Daniel immediately left
him and went upon his way.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
That night Brendon told his wife what he had done, and
she listened while he spoke at length.  He cast no blame
upon her; but very sternly he bade her be more mindful of
herself henceforth; and he warned her with terrible earnestness
that he would hold it no sin to destroy any man who
injured him in his most sacred possession.  His great
self-control on this occasion impressed her more than rage would
have done, and she uttered no protest when he told her of
a fixed intention to leave Ruddyford.
</p>

<p>
"You're right to go," she declared.
</p>

<p>
"John Prout threatened to have me turned off for speaking
rudely of the master this morning," he said.  "Well,
I'll go without being turned off.  I can stop no more after
this, and I won't.  Don't think I'm angered with you or
with him.  I'm not.  I scorn to be.  'Tis only that knave
that has angered me by his evil lie.  This won't end here.
He'll have the law of me for what I've done and disgrace
me, be sure of that.  I must suffer what I must suffer: my
conscience is perfectly at peace about that.  He got less
than he deserved."
</p>

<p>
But time passed, and Jarratt Weekes made no sign.  So
far as Brendon could judge, none even heard of the
encounter.  At any rate, it did not reach his ear again.  It
was said that the horse of Mr. Weekes had lifted its head
suddenly, and given him a pair of black eyes while he was
stooping over its neck.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br><br>
A LUNAR RAINBOW
</h3>

<p>
The folk often called at the cottage of Philip Weekes, for,
despite her loquacity, Hephzibah was known for a woman
of judgment, and her friends, with practice, had learned
to pick the grains of sense from that chaff of words in which
it whirled.
</p>

<p>
On an evening some time after the reported accident to
her son, Mrs. Weekes sat in the midst of a little company,
for several men had dropped in on various errands.
</p>

<p>
Her kitchen reeked with tobacco-smoke.  Philip and
Mr. Huggins were side by side on a settle by the fire;
Mr. Churchward occupied a chair near the table, and Mrs. Weekes
herself sat beside it darning stockings.  A bottle of
sloe gin stood on a tray near her.
</p>

<p>
The schoolmaster thought more highly of Hephzibah than
did she of him; but since Jarratt had chosen his daughter,
she was always civil.
</p>

<p>
The talk ran on Adam's son.
</p>

<p>
"He has succeeded in getting a pictorial effort hung at
a public exhibition in Plymouth," said Mr. Churchward.
"They are holding a picture show there&mdash;all West Country
artists; and I confess I am gratified to hear that William
has been chosen.  I think of taking Mary down to see it
presently.  Perhaps, if we selected the market-day, you
would join us, Mrs. Weekes?"
</p>

<p>
"Likely!" she answered.  "Me trapsing about looking
at pictures, and my stall&mdash;&mdash;there, you men!  Guy Fawkes
and good angels!  And you go about saying you've got all
the sense!  I could wish your son might find something
better to do, I'm sure, for there's no money to it, and never
will be."
</p>

<p>
"The art of photography will be a serious stroke to the
painters of pictures, no doubt," admitted Mr. Churchward.
"Yet such things have not the colours of nature which the
artist's brush produces&mdash;nor have they the life."
</p>

<p>
"As to life," she answered, "there's a proper painted
picture down to Plymouth in a shop near the market&mdash;the
best picture as ever I see in all my days.  Two mice gnawing
a bit of Stilton cheese.  Life!  Why, <i>'tis</i> life.  You
can pretty near smell the cheese.  And only two pound
ten, for the ticket's on it.  If you want life, there you are;
but it have been in that window a year to my certain
knowledge.  Nobody wants it, and nobody wants your son's
daubs.  He'd much better give over and burn all his trash."
</p>

<p>
"He can't, my dear woman.  'Tis in his blood&mdash;he must
be painting, like I must be teaching and you must be selling.
We're built on a pattern, Mrs. Weekes, and that pattern
we must work out against all odds.  William is a <i>lusus
naturæ</i> as one may say&mdash;a freak of nature."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry for you," answered she.  "There's nought
to be proud of, anyhow.  Where's the cleverness in fashioning
things that ban't worth more in open market than the
dirt pies the childer make in the road?  Better paint houses,
and get paid, than paint pictures and get nought."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a most curious thing that such a huge man as the
'Infant' do always paint such little pickshers," said
Mr. Huggins.  "Why&mdash;them things what Noah Pearn have got
hanging up in the bar parlour ban't bigger than a sheet
of writing paper.  Yet, from the tremendous size of the
man, you'd have thought he'd have taken a public-house
signboard at the very least."
</p>

<p>
"Size in matters of pictorial art is nothing, Valentine,"
explained the schoolmaster.  "Some of the biggest books
and pictures have been written and painted by the smallest
men of their inches you could imagine."
</p>

<p>
"All the same, give me they whacking pickshers you see
hanging outside a circus," said Mr. Huggins.  "In my
time I've marked pickshers to the full so large as a
rick-cloth, all a-flaming with tigers and spotted leopards and
wild men, till you might think you was walking straight
into them savage, foreign places where such things come
from.  If William could paint like that, I doubt he'd make
a fortune."
</p>

<p>
"He would scorn to do it, Val.  However, you are quite
right when you say they would produce more money, for
such is life.  People don't want&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Philip Weekes rose.
</p>

<p>
"There's somebody knocking at the door," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Susan, I expect," answered his wife.  "My stars, the
airs and graces of these giglet girls nowadays!  What
d'you think?  She's started an evening out!  And
Mr. Woodrow&mdash;more shame to him&mdash;never raised any objection;
and now, of a Thursday, she puts on her little silly frills
and feathers, and goes off on her own account, Lord knows
where, like a grown-up person!  But I told him, as her
aunt, that she had to be in by half after nine.  And that
she does do&mdash;else I'll have her back here again."
</p>

<p>
It was not Susan, but John Prout, who now entered.
"Just dropped in for a tell and a pipe afore I go
homeward," he explained.  "Been seeing master, and it have
cast me down."
</p>

<p>
"He's a deal better, in my opinion," said Philip.
"Livelier like, and I should say he'd put on flesh.  Anyway
he's going to leave Lydford come spring, for Jarratt
means to be in his house afore Lady Day."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prout nodded and filled his pipe.  At the same
moment Jarratt Weekes himself entered.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo!" he said.  "Have 'e got a party?"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis your mother's ripe wisdom, Jar, as draws us men,"
answered Mr. Huggins.
</p>

<p>
"An' her ripe sloe gin, I reckon.  Has anybody seed
Mrs. Brendon?  My wife tells me that she's in Lydford
to-night."
</p>

<p>
"I seed her at tea-time," answered Philip.  "She was
going up to visit Billy Long's wife&mdash;her that broke her leg
in the gorge last August."
</p>

<p>
"Then I'll go that way myself," declared the younger
Weekes.  "I want a word with her."
</p>

<p>
"Tell her to call here, then, please; 'tis a rough night.
Us'll go home-along together," said John Prout.
</p>

<p>
"She don't want you," answered Hephzibah.
</p>

<p>
"I know that; but I want her.  She's as strong as a
man, and I ban't now, worse luck.  Sarah Jane will give
me an arm up over White Hill, where the wind will be
blowing a hurricane to-night.  I had to go down in a hurry
to Little Lydford on foot, and I'm cruel weary."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Weekes poured out a large wine-glass of cordial for
him.
</p>

<p>
"How's Mr. Woodrow?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Just been there.  There's things troubling him.  Even
to me he was a thought short&mdash;distracted like.  Wouldn't
talk business, and sent me off almost afore I'd sat down.
There's something on his mind without a doubt."
</p>

<p>
"His health?"
</p>

<p>
"Not that.  I judge he's better if anything.  But he's
terrible lonely."
</p>

<p>
"Vicar's son often goes in to have a talk, I believe," said
Philip.
</p>

<p>
"Vicar would stop it if he knowed, however.  Mr. Woodrow's
opinions are very queer, so 'tis rumoured,"
declared Mr. Huggins.
</p>

<p>
Prout sighed, drank his sloe gin, with many thanks to
the giver.  Then he rose painfully.
</p>

<p>
"I won't stop, for if I get stiff 'twill be a grief to my
bones going home.  If you don't mind, Jarratt, I'll go along
with you."
</p>

<p>
"What I want to say to Sarah Jane's a matter of a
little business touching her better half," the castle-keeper
explained.
</p>

<p>
"So you shall, then.  I'll walk out of earshot.  But the
night gets worse, and we'd better be on our way, if I'm
to make as far as Ruddyford at all.  I ought to have ridden,
but I'd been on my pony all morning, and he was tired too."
</p>

<p>
They departed into rough weather.  The moon was rising
through a scud of light thin cloud, and fine rain, swept by
the wind, drove out of the west.
</p>

<p>
"What will Hilary Woodrow do when he leaves my
place?" asked Weekes.
</p>

<p>
"Don't know no more than you," answered the other.
</p>

<p>
They went to the house of Billy Long, and found that
Sarah Jane had left it an hour before.
</p>

<p>
"She's half-way home now, no doubt," said Prout.
"Well, I'll be going, Jarratt.  I'll tell her you want to
see her."
</p>

<p>
"And tell her unbeknownst to her husband, please.
There's no harm brewed, I need not tell you that; but he's a
peppery chap and his temper sometimes obscures his wits."
</p>

<p>
"It does.  He talks of going away now."
</p>

<p>
"Going away!  I hadn't heard that."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prout proceeded.  Then an idea struck Jarratt.
</p>

<p>
"You'm weary&mdash;see here; if we cross my orchard, behind
the cottage, you'll save more than a quarter of a mile.
'Tis trespassing, so long as Woodrow rents the place, but
he'll pardon the owner; anyway, he'll pardon you."
</p>

<p>
"Anything to save a few yards.  I'd ask master for a
shakedown here, but they'd be frighted out of their wits
at Ruddyford if I didn't come back."
</p>

<p>
"Shall I see if I can get somebody to drive you out?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no; I can do it, if I go slow and steady.  Us'll
walk through the orchard certainly."
</p>

<p>
"Don't speak near the back-side of the house, then, else
he'll hear you, and think 'tis people stealing the apples."
</p>

<p>
They went silently through the orchard, but the wind
concealed lesser sounds and panted loudly overhead.  Then
they passed under a lighted window that faced upon their
way.  The blind was drawn down, but a bright beam shot
along one side.  On the impulse of the moment Weekes
peeped in.
</p>

<p>
"Reading one of his eternal books, I'll wager," he
whispered.
</p>

<p>
Then every muscle tightened.  He glared and grinned
out of the darkness into the light, and fell back with a great
gasp.  His mind worked quickly.  Prout had plodded on,
and Weekes now hastened after him.
</p>

<p>
"Come back, come back," he said.  "'Tis worth a few
steps.  'Twill do your heart good&mdash;quick!"
</p>

<p>
The other found himself dragged to the window before he
knew what Jarratt meant.  His face was thrust to the
aperture at the blind edge.  He could not choose but see.
The whole incident occupied but a second, and John Prout
fell back and nearly dropped upon the grass.  His stick left
his fingers: both his hands went up over his face.
</p>

<p>
"Ban't true&mdash;ban't true!" he groaned.
</p>

<p>
Jarratt Weekes picked up his stick and hastened the old
man away.
</p>

<p>
"True as hell-fire," he said.  "And never fool yourself
to think you haven't seen it; for you have."
</p>

<p>
He laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Thank the Lord I waited," he went on.  "This was
worth waiting for!  This be worth chewing over too!  I
shan't be in no hurry now!  I'll bide a thought longer still.
Keep up, my old chap!  Your master's got a bit of life in
him after all&mdash;eh?"
</p>

<p>
The other pushed off the arm that had supported him.
</p>

<p>
"Go&mdash;go, for God's sake," he cried.  "And if you're a
man, forget&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The beauty of it is, that if he'd not quarrelled with me,
I should never have found this out," said Weekes gleefully.
"You know so much, John, that I'll tell you a bit more
now.  'Twasn't my horse, but Daniel Brendon's leg-o-mutton
fist, that blacked my eyes and turned my face yellow
and blue a bit ago.  He felled me with a blow that might
have killed me, because I warned him that his wife saw too
much of yonder man.  And if he'd not done it, I should
not have wanted words with the woman, and never been
here to-night.  So he's brewed his own drink.  D'you mark
how God works in the world, Prout?"
</p>

<p>
He laughed again, and, waiting for no answer, vanished
upon his way.
</p>

<p>
The old man remained trembling and irresolute.  Then he
turned again and went back and stood opposite Hilary
Woodrow's dwelling under the rain.  For twenty minutes
he waited; then the church clock struck half-past nine, and
Susan, with a youth holding an umbrella over her head,
arrived.  Her friend put down the umbrella, kissed Susan
twice, then shook hand with her, and then departed.  She
entered the house, and a moment later Sarah Jane left it
by a back entrance, and slipped into the road.
</p>

<p>
"Be that Mrs. Brendon?" Prout called out.
</p>

<p>
She stopped, and he approached her.
</p>

<p>
"Why, John, whatever are you doing down here?  Lucky
we met.  I can give you an arm up-over.  'Tis a fierce
night, seemingly."
</p>

<p>
Through the wild weather they passed, presently breasted
White Hill, and bent to the tremendous stroke of the wind.
Fierce thin rain drove across the semi-darkness, and where
a rack of cloud was torn wildly into tatters, the hunter's
moon seemed to plough and plunge upon her way, through
the stormy seas of the sky.  The wind whistled, but the
heath was wet, and the dead heather did not utter the
musical, tinkling note that the east wind's besom rings
from it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prout was very silent.
</p>

<p>
"Be I travelling too fast for you?" she asked him.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," he answered.
</p>

<p>
"I'll ax you not to tell Dan that I went to see the
master to-night," she said.
</p>

<p>
He did not reply.
</p>

<p>
"Dan don't understand him like you and me do," she
continued.
</p>

<p>
"For God's sake don't talk," he begged.  "There's a
cruel lot on my mind."
</p>

<p>
"And on mine, for that matter.  I'm a wicked, joyful
woman, John Prout!"
</p>

<p>
For some time silence fell between them as they were
thrust before the wind.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my God, what a terrible, beautiful world it is!"
she cried suddenly.  "But cruel difficult sometimes."
</p>

<p>
He could not speak to her.
</p>

<p>
"D'you know what's going to happen?" she asked.
"I mustn't tell Daniel, but I must tell somebody or 'twill
kill me.  Mr. Woodrow&mdash;he thinks the wide world of
dear Daniel.  He puts him first&mdash;first afore all in his
mind."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Prout groaned, and she extended her hand to him.
</p>

<p>
"I do wish you'd take my arm, John.  This be too
heavy work for your weak legs."
</p>

<p>
He took it.  He longed to speak and pray her for her own
sake, and for his master's sake, to keep Brendon to his
resolution.  His master was the uppermost thought.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Woodrow's going to write a will," said Sarah
Jane.  "I prayed him not; I prayed him not to think of
death, or any such thing.  His be a very beautiful, generous
life, John."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, woman, why was you let come into it?"
</p>

<p>
"I love him, John."
</p>

<p>
"Don't&mdash;don't, for Christ's sake, tell these things.  I
can't bear 'em."
</p>

<p>
"I love him&mdash;because he loves me, but more because
he loves Dan so much.  He mustn't die&mdash;he&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Leave it&mdash;shut your mouth, or I won't say what I'll
answer.  God's over all&mdash;let me cling to that.  I'd cut
my heart out for him&mdash;but&mdash;there, never you speak to me
about him again&mdash;never&mdash;never.  I wish I had died afore
to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Don't take on.  I'll pay if&mdash;&mdash;  You won't tell Dan
I was with him.  'Twould spoil all&mdash;Dan being what he
is.  And you won't say a word of this great news.  He's
to speak to Daniel himself.  What joy for Daniel!  How
he'll bless his God&mdash;eh, John?"
</p>

<p>
Prout dragged himself helplessly and silently beside her.
Then a wonderful spectacle appeared above them in the
firmament.
</p>

<p>
From the depth of the northern heavens there sprang
an immense halo of colourless light, where the moon shone
upon unnumbered particles of flying rain.  Wan, yet
luminous, flung with one perfect sweep upon the storm, it
endured&mdash;the only peaceful thing in that wild world of
tumultuous cloud and clamouring wind.  The arch of the
lunar rainbow threw its solemn and radiant span across the
whole earth from west to east.  It framed all Dartmoor,
and one shining foot seemed to sink upon the Severn Sea,
while the other marked the places of the dawn.
</p>

<p>
They stood and stared a moment; then both were nearly
blown off their legs and driven forward by the sudden
buffet of the gale.
</p>

<p>
"Heaven be over all, like that beautiful silvery bow
above our heads," she cried loud in his ear.
</p>

<p>
"There's no rainbow for me," he answered.  "And
there didn't ought to be for you, woman."
</p>

<p>
"How do I know?  I only know my heart be merry
when I think on Daniel.  Who can do wrong that brings
joyfulness to good people?"
</p>

<p>
He groaned again and she misunderstood.
</p>

<p>
"Don't take on so and be sad for master.  There's
happiness even for him in the world still&mdash;here and there;
and happiness is God's gift, I suppose.  None else can
give it to a man&mdash;so my Dan says.  Them as bring it be
the messengers&mdash;only the messengers.  All the same, I
hate only Heaven to be thanked when a man or woman
does a brave, lovely thing."
</p>

<p>
"Won't you never be like other females?" he asked.
"Seeing what your husband is, God help the reckoning."
</p>

<p>
"Leave it so," she answered, "and say nought to nobody.
You know nothing more than that I love the man&mdash;so
do you&mdash;for pity&mdash;and for his gentle thoughts&mdash;and
for his loneliness&mdash;aye, and for his own self too.  I'll say
that to you.  He's a good man.  He does countless good
things; you know that.  Don't torment yourself for him&mdash;or
me.  Forget you met me to-night.  Here's the
stepping-stones, an' the moon hidden, just when we wanted the
light most.  Take hold of my hand.  I'm stronger far than
you."
</p>

<p>
They crossed the water carefully, and the great shape
of Daniel Brendon loomed up ahead.
</p>

<p>
"At last!" he shouted.  "I beginned to think you was
night-foundered in the storm.  Did you see that wonder
in the sky a bit ago?"
</p>

<p>
Once more Sarah Jane spoke swiftly to Prout before
they reached the other.
</p>

<p>
"Mind this too," she said.  "There's the joy of giving,
John.  'Tis a dear joy to give!  Hilary Woodrow knows
that&mdash;so do I&mdash;none better than him and me."
</p>

<p>
The old man drew a grief-stricken breath, and left her
with her husband.

BOOK III
</h2>

<p><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br><br>
BRENDON STOPS AT RUDDYFORD
</h3>

<p>
Even Joe Tapson expressed regret when Daniel Brendon
decided to leave Ruddyford, and let his decision become
known.  All begged him to reconsider the step; all bluntly
asked where he expected to find more satisfactory
employment, a happier home, and equal money.  Prout had been
among those who urged him most strenuously to reconsider
his determination.  Then shone the lunar rainbow,
and from that hour the head man was silent.
</p>

<p>
Three days later Daniel, after long brooding, set off to
do two things.  He meant to visit Jarratt Weekes and
express contrition for his recent violence; and he intended
to call upon his master, that he might give notice of his
approaching departure from Ruddyford.
</p>

<p>
Joe met him on the way, saw that Daniel wore Sunday
clothes, guessed his mission, and made a final appeal.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you be a fool, Dan.  A man's only worth what
he'll fetch, as you ought to know.  I withstood you so
long as I could do it, and, to this day, I don't reckon you
be worth a penny more in open market than what I be
myself; because, though I've but one eye, it sees further
than the two of many men I could name; and though
you've got larger muscles upon you than me, yet I won't
grant your brains be ahead of mine by an inch.  However,
he thought different, and he's the purse, so 'tis for us to
mind our own business and keep our opinions in check.
I've long larned to do that."
</p>

<p>
"You mistake me, Joe," answered the other.  "My
money's all right, and the place is all right, and I shall
be mighty sorry to go from you all&mdash;you as much as any
man, for in your way you've taught me a great deal worth
knowing.  But life have got an inside and an outside to
it; an' 'tis the inside of mine I ban't too pleased with.
More than good wages and good friends go to peace of
mind."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I hope he'll make you change your ideas, for
I'm sure he'll try."
</p>

<p>
"The more he tries, the steadfaster shall I stand."
</p>

<p>
"More fool you, then.  However, go your way.  I know
a chap who'd be very wishful to fill your shoes, an' a very
willing boy, though 'twill be like David coming to do
Goliath's work."
</p>

<p>
Brendon called at Adam Churchward's and learned from
Jarratt's wife that he was at Lydford Castle.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis his last season there," she said; "for he've
grown too big a man for that small work now, and his
time's better worth.  I wanted to make him give it up
long ago, but he don't like dropping sure money, even
though 'tis small money.  However, they've appointed
young Teddy Westover to succeed him&mdash;old Westover's
grandson."
</p>

<p>
"I'm much obliged to you," answered Daniel.  "I'll
seek him there."
</p>

<p>
Presently, as a party left the ruin, Brendon met Weekes,
and asked to be allowed to speak to him.
</p>

<p>
Jarratt hid his heart and consented to listen.  He nodded
gravely while Brendon apologized, explained that he had
acted from worthy motives, and added that he had told
nobody&mdash;not even his wife&mdash;of the outrage put upon him
by Daniel.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry to God," said Brendon.  "I was wrong
every way to smite you.  Whether you was right to speak
what you did, I won't say.  I don't know.  I only know
that I'd no right to answer so.  And I ask you to forgive
an erring man.  I was shaken from my hold on the
Lord&mdash;surprised away from it by the shock of what you said.
You were wrong in your opinion&mdash;that I do steadfastly
know; but none the less&mdash;&mdash;  But I ban't here to make
any excuses.  I'm sorry to the heart, and I beg you to
forgive me."
</p>

<p>
"I will do so, Daniel Brendon."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you.  There's another thing.  I've got a
five-pound note here.  I heard as you kept your bed for two
days.  That means I did more than hurt you.  I robbed
you of money.  Please to take this.  'Tis a sign that you
forgive me properly if you take it."
</p>

<p>
He held out the note and Weekes extended his hand
quickly, then drew it back.
</p>

<p>
"I was off work three days, to be exact.  But five
pounds for three days would be ten for a week.  That's
five hundred and twenty for the year."
</p>

<p>
"Ban't it enough?"
</p>

<p>
Weekes laughed.
</p>

<p>
"That's a home question; however, since you want to
do the honest thing, I won't stand in your way."
</p>

<p>
He took out a heavy leather purse and put the note
into it.
</p>

<p>
"Now we'll cry quits.  Don't let this go no further."
</p>

<p>
Weekes shook hands and left Daniel abruptly; but the
big man felt satisfied.  He held that, save for his own
lasting regret, the matter was now concluded.  He
continued to be ashamed of himself when he reflected upon
it; but he ceased to feel any pity for Jarratt Weekes, and
he could not satisfy himself that the other's motives had
been pure.
</p>

<p>
Now Daniel called upon his master and found him at
home.
</p>

<p>
"I came because of the rain," he said.  "I knew
'twould hold you to the house."
</p>

<p>
Hilary was writing, and held his hand for silence.  Then
he finished a page and blotted it.  Various papers littered
his desk, and, among others, lay a large one, rolled up and
tied round the middle with pink tape.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Dan.  This is a funny coincidence.  I
sent for you an hour ago.  You missed my messenger."
</p>

<p>
"I met no messenger."
</p>

<p>
Woodrow rose and took his pipe from the mantelshelf.
</p>

<p>
"Let's have your business first, then you shall know
mine.  Sit down.  We don't see one another often enough.
I wish you'd come more frequently."
</p>

<p>
Brendon took a chair and put his soft black hat under it.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis harder to speak afore those kind words, master.
And yet&mdash;I've got to do it.  I want to go&mdash;I must go.
This is to give notice, please.  I'll suit your convenience,
of course.  Perhaps after Christmas.  I'm mighty sorry
for many reasons.  Still, 'twill be the best thing."
</p>

<p>
An expression of real pain crossed the face of Hilary
Woodrow.
</p>

<p>
"How can you say this, Daniel?  Don't you care more
than that for me?  I thought&mdash;why, good God&mdash;I hold you
dearer than almost anybody in the world!  You're far,
far more to me than a servant.  You&mdash;a friend&mdash;to say
this!  You, my right hand, to ask to be cut off!"
</p>

<p>
"I know you set store by me.  I know how good you've
been&mdash;yet&mdash;we can't say all we know.  You mustn't think
'tis a small thing; you mustn't think I'm not grateful,
master.  I owe you far more than 'tis in my power to pay.
I pray for you.  'Tis all I can do&mdash;all the poor can do for
the rich&mdash;to pray for 'em.  My work's nought.  That's
the everyday business between man and man.  For that you
pay, and pay well.  But prayer's beyond.  I tell you this
because, afore I go, I want you to know I'm more than
just a strong man working for wages."
</p>

<p>
"You shall not go!  This is a matter far beyond the
farm, or the welfare of the farm.  You are a great deal to
me.  You are an example to me and to all of us.  While
you have prayed for me, I&mdash;I haven't prayed, since I know
of nothing to pray to that has ears to hear&mdash;but I've done
what I could&mdash;according to my lights."
</p>

<p>
"I know that.  You've been good and generous to me.
There's nothing&mdash;nothing I can say against you."
</p>

<p>
"I can't part with you, Dan.  I won't believe the reason
is beyond explanation.  Be honest with me&mdash;absolutely.
Tell me why this idea has come to you.  You're at a point
far more vital in your career than you think for.  Don't
leave any shadow or uncertainty.  Be dead straight about
it, Dan."
</p>

<p>
Brendon did not answer, but he struggled fiercely with
himself.  He was a great-hearted man, and now, within
sound of his master's voice, in sight of his earnest eyes,
his reason dwindled somewhat.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he blurted out the truth.
</p>

<p>
"Jarratt Weekes told me a while ago that you saw too
much of Sarah Jane.  I believe that he said it without
malice.  He thought so&mdash;like as not others do."
</p>

<p>
A great expiration left the lungs of Woodrow.
</p>

<p>
"Too much of her!  No, Dan&mdash;not too much of her&mdash;not
enough; but too much of this dirty little village and
the mean-minded vermin that live in it!  Nobody could
see too much of Sarah Jane&mdash;any more than they could see
too much of the sun in the sky, or hear too much of the song
of the birds.  I don't see enough of her&mdash;or of you.  How
glad I am you had the pluck to speak!"
</p>

<p>
"One thing I must ask of you&mdash;to take no step against
Weekes.  I've punished him.  I nearly broke his neck
when he said it.  I knew 'twas a lie; but, of course, I
can't live where 'tis possible to tell such lies."
</p>

<p>
"You'll never get beyond the reach of falsehood in this
world, Dan.  Lying is woven into the fabric of all human
life&mdash;part of the regular pattern.  We should be like the
beasts that perish if we did not lie.  Civilized existence
rests on a bedrock of lying.  'Tis the cement that keeps
every state together; the first necessity of conscious
existence.  Only Nature can work without falsehood.  The lie
is as old as human language.  If men said what they
thought, the world's work would stand still.  Try it&mdash;yet I
wouldn't ask you to do that.  Why should I wish my best
friend to have nought but enemies?"
</p>

<p>
"I won't live where 'tis possible to tell this lie," repeated
Brendon.
</p>

<p>
"If you believed the lie&mdash;then I should be the first to
ask you to be gone.  Happily you don't.  I've not got
much heart, Brendon; but the little I have would break if
I thought you did not care for me.  If there is a thing that
I've hoped and planned and rejoiced to plan in this fading
life of mine, it is your future."
</p>

<p>
"My future!  That's God's work to plan&mdash;not yours."
</p>

<p>
"I know it is.  But in one of these conversations I held
with your wife, which have shocked this low-minded rascal,
she said a fine thing to me, Dan.  She said, 'All good
things come from my man's God.  You can't have no good
without His hand be in it.  And men and women are His
messengers to carry the goodness of God up and down in
the world and show it.'"
</p>

<p>
"That's true enough.  Nothing new, surely?"
</p>

<p>
"It was new to me.  If there's a God, Daniel, He is a
good God.  I'll grant you so much.  And if good comes to
any man, 'tis his God that sends it.  I suppose you believe
that?"
</p>

<p>
"Where else can good come from?  Man's heart don't
imagine it.  Man's heart don't breed it."
</p>

<p>
"Then you're answered, for into my heart has long
since come the wish to do you good.  I desire it, and I
am thankful that I can perform it.  I wish you to have
power, because you understand how to use power wisely; and
content, because you are the only man I ever met who
understood that content is higher than happiness."
</p>

<p>
"You've done all you could, and I have thanked you."
</p>

<p>
"And thanked your God, I warrant?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;Him first."
</p>

<p>
"It's good to thank Him, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"It's right&mdash;it's natural&mdash;'tis all we can give Him&mdash;our
thanks and worship."
</p>

<p>
"Then take my hand, Daniel, and say I've cleared this
cloud.  Don't make my sad life sadder by going out of it.
Don't say I may not sometimes see and speak with
Mrs. Brendon.  If you had a beautiful and rare flower in your
garden, you would not deny other people the sight of it.
'Tis a parallel case every way.  She is a remarkable
woman, full of high qualities.  I ask you to be my close
friend henceforth, Brendon.  It would seem a strange
thing for a master to ask of his man.  Yet I do it.  Prout
is my friend and I want you too, because you are much
more to me than good old John, or any other man on
earth."
</p>

<p>
He stopped and coughed, then rose, took a wisp of paper
from a china jar, and re-lighted his pipe.
</p>

<p>
Brendon did not speak.  Woodrow's words troubled him
at one moment, gratified him at the next; now the farmer
said a thing that made him start, and, before he had
grasped it, the quick, nervous voice passed on and uttered
some word that could not fail to soften his heart.
</p>

<p>
"Say you'll stop, Dan," continued Hilary Woodrow.
"Say you'll stop, before I come to my affair.  'Twill spoil
all if you cleave to this determination.  'Twill make the
thing I have plotted all dust and ashes.  Yet I won't
influence you with it.  I won't influence you save to say
this: I'm not going to be in the land of the living more
than a few years at best; but you'll cloud those years for
me, Daniel, if you go; and as sure as your God's watching
you to-day, you'll be sorry afterwards, if you stick to this
determination."
</p>

<p>
He turned to the window, and smoked and looked out
into the little street.
</p>

<p>
For a minute or two neither spoke.  Then Brendon bent
for his hat, picked it up, and rose.
</p>

<p>
"Since you put it that way, and say so solemnly that
'tis in my power to better your life by stopping, then I'll
stop, master.  Don't think I wanted to go, but for what I
told you.  'Twas the only thing in the world that would
have took me.  But since 'tis false, I'll spurn it.  My
God's Self's a jealous God, but&mdash;there 'tis&mdash;I'll fight to be
large-minded&mdash;I'll stop&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Woodrow did not speak, but his eyes were damp when
he turned from the window and came back to the table.  A
strange conflict of emotions filled his spirit, choked his
throat, seethed upward to his brain, and sunk downward to
his heart.  His admiration and even affection for Daniel
were genuine enough at that moment; and he rejoiced at
the thing that he was about to do.  But not for an instant
did he mourn the thing that he had done.
</p>

<p>
He could not speak immediately.
</p>

<p>
He took the other's hand and shook it very warmly.
Then he picked up the packet on the table, dragged the
tape off, and gave it to Brendon.
</p>

<p>
"Read," he said.
</p>

<p>
The giant, amazed at such emotion, stared dumbly out
of his dark, dog-like eyes, opened the packet and knit his
brows to peruse the calligraphy.
</p>

<p>
Woodrow walked about the room while Daniel read his
will.  It was short, and took but three minutes.  Then
Brendon put the paper on the table again.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me one thing," he said.  "Be you sure that to
do this is not to wrong some other&mdash;somebody of your own
kin who have a right to it all?  Can you swear that?"
</p>

<p>
"None has a right.  I'm alone in the world.  My kin
are remote and nothing to me.  They are well-to-do, and
have no anxiety.  You must keep John Prout easy and
comfortable until he dies, and also his sister&mdash;that's the
only condition."
</p>

<p>
"I can't bring it home to my mind.  'Tis too much to
happen to a man.  I don't know what to say."
</p>

<p>
"Say you're my friend, that's all I want you to say."
</p>

<p>
"'Your friend'!  This is not friendship.  This is a
thing greater than friendship.  I know how to thank my
God; I don't know what to say to you, master."
</p>

<p>
"Not master.  Thank me by calling me 'master' no
more.  Thank me by seeing me oftener&mdash;both of you.
Talk to me.  Tell me all you believe, and why you believe
it.  Help me, if you can.  Perhaps your God will look to
it that you pay me so well that my gift shall be dross to
your gold.  Stranger things have happened.  I'd dearly
like to believe in a world beyond this, Daniel, before I go
to find out for myself.  Now be off for a while.
Good-bye&mdash;friend Daniel."
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye.  I be dumb still&mdash;in a maze.  I'm surely
dreaming this."
</p>

<p>
"Tell nobody&mdash;not a soul except your wife.  But ask
her not to mention it."
</p>

<p>
Brendon went away entranced, and was nearly run over
at the corner of the street by a waggon laden with straw.
The carter laughed at him.
</p>

<p>
"Ban't often us catches you mooning about in the
middle of the road!" he said.
</p>

<p>
Daniel climbed White Hill presently and looked down at
Ruddyford.  Then his eyes atoned for his lack of
imagination, and helped him to understand and realize the
prodigious thing that had happened.
</p>

<p>
This place would be his own.  He would be master
presently, and his child would follow him.  It rushed upon
him in a wave&mdash;drowned him almost, so that he panted for
air.  His mind turned to Woodrow, and, with heart and
soul, he hoped that the farmer might enjoy length of days.
He determined with himself that evermore he would add to
his prayer for Woodrow that it might please God to let
him see Truth before he died.  He thought of himself
being allowed to make Woodrow a Christian.
</p>

<p>
For a while he gazed, then considered Sarah Jane's joy.
Suddenly his mind turned back to Hilary, and next he
turned his body back also.  He began to understand at
last; he yearned to go before the giver again and say a
little of what he felt.  As for God, Dan believed that he
was in His presence all the time.  An under-current of
thanksgiving rose from his soul, like smoke of incense.
</p>

<p>
Words from his favourite, Isaiah, ran through his head
as he swept with great strides back to Lydford:
</p>

<p>
"That He may do His work, His strange work; and
bring to pass His act, His strange act," the man kept
repeating.
</p>

<p>
But the strange act went far deeper than Daniel
conceived.  Of the strange act, strange thoughts were bred
in one man's spirit; and when he was alone, Woodrow
pondered long of the amazing complexity of his own
motives during the past few days, and of the impress
stamped upon present thought and future resolution by
this actual conversation with the husband of Sarah Jane.
He was moved to find how little he had pretended, how
much he had felt; how largely grain of truth mingled with
the seed of falsehood sown by him upon Brendon's heart
in that hour.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br><br>
AFTER CHAPEL
</h3>

<p>
The chapel of the Luke Gospellers was full, and their
pastor won his usual attention.  With very considerable
ability, through a ministry of some ten years, he had lifted
his congregation along with himself to wider thinking.  A
tolerance rare amid the sects of Christianity belonged to him,
and he had imparted something of it to those who suffered
him to lead them.
</p>

<p>
"How great is man, and how small," said the preacher,
as he drew to the close of his address.  "How much he
has grasped at; how little he can hold.  He measures the
journeys of the stars and the paths of comets, marked for
them through utmost space by the God that made them;
but he cannot measure the limit of the growing grass-blade
or the breadth of the petal of a budding flower.  He predicts
when the earth's shadow will fall upon the moon; but he
cannot foretell when the next raindrop will fall upon the
earth.  His intellect has reached out into the universe and
read rightly among the laws of it; but the way of the wind
and the birth of the cloud, the advent of the frost and the
appointed day of the storm&mdash;these are hidden from him.
So also with his conscious nature and his power to do and
to withstand; he is sublime and pitiful at a breath; and
his greatness and littleness interwoven, appear on every
public page of his history and in every private tablet of his
heart."
</p>

<p>
He exhorted them to know themselves, to read their
souls by the light of the Word of God; he told them that
within the spectrum of that light were rays that could
reach to the darkest, secretest chambers of the human
spirit, and search and purify and sweeten them.
</p>

<p>
They listened, were uplifted according to the measure of
their understanding, and went home in the brightness of
the teacher's earnest words.  Then life and the fret of it
came between; and some of the seed perished immediately,
and some was scorched at the springing.
</p>

<p>
Agg and Joe Tapson walked together on their way back
to Ruddyford, and behind them came Sarah Jane, Daniel,
and their little boy.
</p>

<p>
Tapson had already dismissed the service, and was
grumbling to Walter Agg.  They did not know the truth
concerning Brendon and the future of the farm; but of
late, in certain directions, Daniel was still further
advanced, and even Agg felt it hard, because he did not
understand.
</p>

<p>
"He's bewitched Woodrow, if you ax me," said Joe.
"'Tis the evil eye over again.  Farmer can't call his soul
his own now.  He don't seem to care a groat for the place.
Thicky big monster be always right.  Why, if he wanted
to pull down the house and build it again to a new pattern,
I believe it would be done.  Prout's no more good than a
bird on a tree; though he used to hold his own very well.
Now he always says 'ditto' to Brendon."
</p>

<p>
"Not that Brendon be what he exactly was, all the
same," argued Agg.  "He's much gentler and easier,
despite his uplifting.  He don't order anybody about, and
he's always got a good word for a good job well done."
</p>

<p>
"I know that and I grant it.  But who be he to pat us
on the back so masterful?  I don't want his praise any
more than his blame.  Damn it all!  I was getting my
shilling a day afore the man was born!"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis just pushfulness have raised him up."
</p>

<p>
"Why don't I go and pat him on the back and say,
'Well done, Brendon!'?  I've as much right to patronize
him as what he have me," continued Joe.
</p>

<p>
The other laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Well, why don't you?  'Tis beyond words to explain
these things.  But there 'tis.  He's above us&mdash;got there
somehow&mdash;how, I don't know&mdash;had to do it by vartue of
what's in him."
</p>

<p>
"He may come down again, however."
</p>

<p>
"I hope not.  He's a good man, and grows larger-hearted
and gentler as he grows older.  His child have
done a great deal to his character, as I dare say you've
marked."
</p>

<p>
"We've a right to be jealous of him, all the same.
There's no justice in it.  If I came along with great ideas,
who'd listen to me?" asked Mr. Tapson.
</p>

<p>
"That's it," answered Walter Agg very placidly.
"That's just it.  You and me don't get great ideas.  Us
never think of anything worth a lump of peat.  All the
same, Joe, I'll tell you this: me and Peter Lethbridge
was feeling much like you do a bit back.  And I had a tell
with Prout on the subject, and he said a thing worth
remembering in my judgment.  He said, 'Don't envy the
man, souls; never envy nobody.  'Tis only God in heaven
knows if a human creature's to be envied or not.  No
fellow-man can tell.  How should they, for which among
us can say from hour to hour whether even our own lot
be good or evil?'  That's what he spoke to me, and there's
sense in it.  King or tinker may come a cropper, but the
tinker's up soonest.  Not much could happen to me or
you&mdash;especially you, with your wife dead and no children.
Your ill fortune's behind you; and, when all's said, us
ought not to make another man's good luck our bad luck.
'Tis a mean-minded thing, though common."
</p>

<p>
Elsewhere Daniel imparted a great ambition to Sarah
Jane.
</p>

<p>
"I do wish that he could hear Matherson."
</p>

<p>
When either spoke indefinitely now, the other knew that
Hilary Woodrow was meant.
</p>

<p>
"I believe he'd come if you made a favour of it," she
answered.
</p>

<p>
"I'd ask minister to do something out of the common.
Not that he don't put every ounce of his power into his
preaching every week.  But if I said 'Here's a soul coming
to listen to you as be wandering&mdash;lost,' minister might be
lifted to something special."
</p>

<p>
"He'd come for you."
</p>

<p>
"For you more likely.  'Twould be worth the effort
before he goes away, for 'tis pretty certain now he won't
stop here through winter.  He's going to London again,
just for the day, to hear what the doctor says.  He's
better, I believe myself.  There's been a lot more heart and
life in him of late, to my mind."
</p>

<p>
"You're going in to-night to have a pipe along with
him, aren't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I am."
</p>

<p>
"Then ask him&mdash;as a favour to you&mdash;to come to a
service.  Can't hurt him&mdash;so large-minded as he is&mdash;blames
nobody."
</p>

<p>
"I'll ask him&mdash;and yet, I won't.  He knows there'd be
such a lot of meaning in it if I asked him.  He'd think
'twas a deep-laid plot against his opinions.  You ask him
next time you see him.  Say that you'd like him to hear
Mr. Matherson.  Let the thing come as a surprise, not a
planned attack.  If I say anything, he'll know he's to be
preached at, and that would anger him.  But you're
lighter-handed.  You ban't so deadly in earnest as I am."
</p>

<p>
"I'll say 'tis to please me, then, not you."
</p>

<p>
"Do so.  It should be true too.  You ought to be
pleased to get him to come."
</p>

<p>
Brendon now went disarmed.  Even his natural instincts
were lulled.  Sarah Jane did sometimes see the master, and
often brought messages from him to her husband or to
Prout.  Daniel also, at Hilary's express desire, came twice
weekly to smoke with him after the day's work was over.
Brendon was a man capable of great gratitude.  His
fortune had worked largely upon that superficial crust of
his character revealed to fellow-men; and, more than this:
the sun of his great worldly success had warmed his heart
to the core, sweetened his inner nature, made him happier,
smothered something of the canine jealousy that belonged
to him as an ingredient of character.  His trust in God
had led to a rarer thing and taught him to trust man also.
He was gentler than of old, for he found pity in his mind
at the sight of those less fortunate than himself.  He felt
no personal land-hunger, and, had it been in his power,
would have insured full term of years to his master; but
upon his child henceforth he looked with respect, as one
born to possessions.  The unconscious Gregory Daniel
already bulked in his parent's eyes as an owner of property.
He longed for another boy and carefully planned small
Gregory's education.
</p>

<p>
Sarah Jane went to see Woodrow a few days later, and
they spoke intimately together&mdash;first of her and then of
himself.
</p>

<p>
"Don't put off going to see your doctor till the weather
turns."
</p>

<p>
"I have been."
</p>

<p>
"Never!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;last Monday; and back again on Wednesday."
</p>

<p>
"'Twas good news, I hope?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I think so.  Only I must go down to the sea
for the winter.  He will let me stop near at hand.  I mean
to take rooms at Dawlish.  I shall be within reach there.
You'll have to invent reasons for coming to see me
sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"You wasn't no worse?"
</p>

<p>
"Not worth mentioning.  I'll be all right down there.
But it's rather like going into exile."
</p>

<p>
They spoke long about his health, his food, his winter
clothes.  She thought of these things, and had made him
buy thicker and warmer garments.
</p>

<p>
Presently she asked him to come to the chapel of the
Luke Gospellers.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Matherson is a wonderful man, and that learned.
The stars and the trees and the lightning come into his
sermons.  I do think you'd like them.  As broad as charity
he is&mdash;nought frights him."
</p>

<p>
"There are two Books," said Hilary; "and whether
one was written by God is doubtful; but, God granted,
there's no doubt about the other.  Even Mr. Matherson
won't deny who wrote the Book of Nature.  And I'm glad
he's not fool enough to forbid sane people from reading in
it.  But for me to hear him&mdash;would you have me play the
hypocrite?"
</p>

<p>
"Why do you say that?  There's no deceit.  Ban't no
harm to listen.  Your conscience wouldn't say 'no' to
that.  You've often said you'd deny the light to none.  He
might change you."
</p>

<p>
"I only want to be changed when I feel death peeping
at me by night.  It might be very awkward for both of
us if I was changed."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not thinking of that, but after.  'Twould be good
to believe in a life beyond.  You've often said so yourself."
</p>

<p>
"How many secrets will be carried on into that
life&mdash;there is such a life, I wonder?"
</p>

<p>
"Some, for certain&mdash;ours for one."
</p>

<p>
He laughed.
</p>

<p>
"And yet they say all will come to light then."
</p>

<p>
She shook her head resolutely.
</p>

<p>
"We must keep it safe through all eternity."
</p>

<p>
"There's God."
</p>

<p>
"What then?  He don't want to turn Daniel's heaven
into hell.  Too large-hearted for that.  He'll never tell it."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you and I won't be there, Sarah Jane."
</p>

<p>
"We shall be there.  What would Daniel's heaven be
without me, or you, for that matter?"
</p>

<p>
"You've set Dan's God a big puzzle.  However, there
will be no marrying or giving in marriage in heaven."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe not.  But there's brains in heaven.  Angels
ban't bird-witted as well as bird-winged.  Suppose the first
thing my husband heard when he comed to die was that
I'd done&mdash;the thing I have done?  What would eternity
be to him then?  You know him&mdash;you can tell."
</p>

<p>
"He'd have larger views then."
</p>

<p>
"Daniel's Daniel.  'Twould be fire in his bones instead
of marrow, for ever and ever.  But God won't tell him,
Hilary."
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't trust God, all the same&mdash;not if I believed
in God."
</p>

<p>
"'Twould be too cruel; and Dan thanking God so deep
and pure and earnest every day and every night&mdash;and
praying for you."
</p>

<p>
"May his God bless him a thousandfold."
</p>

<p>
"He has&mdash;through you."
</p>

<p>
"He's a grand character in his way.  Prosperity has
sweetened him, so that he'd pick an insect out of his path
nowadays rather than put any creature to pain."
</p>

<p>
"He's all for letting the world share the good that's
come to him.  And why shouldn't he thank God, Hilary?
God's brought the good.  I'll cleave to that&mdash;else how can
I live?"
</p>

<p>
"Then so will I," he said.  "God's my judge, but I'll
believe in God too!  Yet&mdash;yet once&mdash;not so long ago
neither&mdash;I knew a lovely woman that claimed goodness
rather hotly for man, and hated the sky to have all the
praise when pleasant things were done!"
</p>

<p>
He looked out of the window, then he caressed her.
</p>

<p>
"I've changed from that," she said.  "I clung to it
awhile&mdash;then it gived way somehow.  'Tis easier to&mdash;to
put it on God.  All the same, I almost hate a man when
he calls himself a lowly worm, as Daniel often does.  And
I know well that God don't like us to cry bad wares neither.
Bain't no compliment to Him, anyway."
</p>

<p>
"Give man&mdash;and woman&mdash;the praise still.  I like your
old way best.  You're a wonderful darling, and my whole
life; and I'll think just what you please; and I'll come
to hear your minister next Sunday&mdash;even that I'll do&mdash;for
you and Daniel.  Tell him that you nearly made me
promise.  Then he'll surely say a word next time we meet;
and I'll  relent and appear among the faithful!  Is there a
penitent's bench?"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br><br>
JARRATT BECOMES A FATHER
</h3>

<p>
Despite a promise, Hilary Woodrow did not visit the
chapel of the Luke Gospellers.  He caught a chill and
kept the house for a fortnight.  Then he decided that he
must go immediately into the milder climate of the coast,
and left Lydford for Dawlish.  John Prout accompanied
him and stopped for a few days.
</p>

<p>
At last the patience of Mary Weekes was rewarded, and
she became mistress of the ivy-clad house, and the orchard,
and the sweet water from the Moor that ran through her
husband's little domain.
</p>

<p>
A child was to be born to her, and she felt glad that her
own house would see the event.  Susan still remained as
maid-of-all-work; but she let it be understood that her
services could not be depended upon for more than a year
at the utmost.  Then a certain square-built youth, called
Bobby Huggins, one of Valentine's many grandchildren,
intended to marry her.  A cottage and a wife would be
within his reach at the expiration of that time; and all men
admitted that Bobby's deserts embraced both.  He was
an under-gamekeeper, and no more promising and steadfast
spirit had ever shone in the great family of Huggins.
</p>

<p>
It happened that the patriarch himself called on Philip
Weekes three days after Christmas, and accepted
Hephzibah's invitation to stop and eat a mouthful.
</p>

<p>
"Master ban't home yet," she said; "though I believe
I've made it clear to him for the last forty year that one
o'clock's the dinner-hour in this house.  But there&mdash;time
be a word to him.  'Time was made for slaves,' he said
once to me, in one of his particular foolish moments.
'Go along with you, you silly old monkey!' I answered
him.  'Time was made for humans, and we was no more
expected to waste it like water, same as you do, than we
was meant to waste corn and food and greenstuff and
money.'  But there&mdash;you know him.  A watch he carries,
but ain't got no more use for it than if he walked in New
Jerusalem, where night and day will be done away with for
evermore.  Us'll begin, Mr. Huggins."
</p>

<p>
They ate and drank; then Philip joined them.
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad to see you," he said.  "And I wish you a
very happy New Year, Val, and a good few more yet."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, thank you," answered the veteran.  "I
hope so too, I'm sure, for the balance of comfort in going
on living be still my side, and will be while I've got such
a rally of friendly neighbours wishing me to live.  This be
pretty drinking, sure enough.  What do'e call it,
Mrs. Weekes, if I ban't making a hole in my manners to ax?"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis broth made from the rames[<a id="chap0303fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0303fn1">1</a>] of the Christmas
goose," said Mrs. Weekes.  "For richness there's nought
like goose-bone soup&mdash;dripping with fatness, you might
say.  The very smell of it is a meal."

<p>
Presently Philip pressed Mr. Huggins to take a slice of
cold plum-pudding, but the guest reluctantly refused.
</p>

<p>
"Daren't do it, though with all the will in the world,
my dears," he declared.  "Hot plum-pudding be death,
but cold's damnation&mdash;using the word in its Bible sense.
When you'm up home fourscore, such things must be
passed by.  Not but what I've had my share, and ate it
without fear till seventy; but there's nowhere age tells
crueller than in the power of the frame to manage victuals.
Well I mind the feast when my granddarter, Hester&mdash;now
Mrs. Gill&mdash;was married.  Gill was to work at a wine
merchant's in them days, and his master give him a bottle
of glittering wine."
</p>

<p>
"Champagne, no doubt," said Mrs. Weekes.
</p>

<p>
"So it was then; and nothing would do but I must top
up my other beverages with a glass of it, when it came to
be taken at the end of the feast.  Next day I wasn't hungry
till four in the afternoon!  ''Tis age upon me,' I said to
myself.  'Tis the sure hand of age.  Time was when I
could have tossed off a quart of that frothy rubbish an'
thought no more of it than a cup of tea; now the organs
is losing their grip of liquid food, an' any fancy drinking
defies them.'  'Tis the same with solids.  If I was to
partake of that Christmas pudden, 'twould harbour, like a
cannon-ball, under the small ribs on my left side and stick
there, very likely, till the spring, unless doctor could
dislodge it."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a bad thing to have the inner tubes out of
order&mdash;nobody knows that better'n what I do," confessed
Mrs. Weekes.  "My unfortunate spasms be all owing to some
lifelong failure in the tubes."
</p>

<p>
"Through peppermint comes salvation, however,"
murmured Philip.
</p>

<p>
He had just uttered this great truth when Susan rushed
wildly upon them, and in doing so precipitated one of those
identical agitations her aunt had just deplored.
</p>

<p>
"Lord save us, you little fool!" cried Philip.  "Bursting
into a room so&mdash;all endwise, like a frightened fowl!
Don't you know your aunt better?"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis cousin Mary&mdash;she's took.  Jar's gone for doctor,
and Mrs. Taverner's along with her, and of course I come
for Aunt Hepsy."
</p>

<p>
"Took!  So like as not you're lying.  'Tis a fortnight
afore the time."
</p>

<p>
"Don't know nothing about that," answered Susan.
"But took she is&mdash;for good or evil&mdash;so you'd better come,
I reckon.  Anyway, she cried out for you the moment she
got bad."
</p>

<p>
"A pretty darling, and well she might!" said
Mrs. Weekes.  "Thank the watching Lord she's in her own
house, and the schoolmaster ain't there to add another
terror to the scene."
</p>

<p>
"He is there," answered Susan.  "He's in the parlour,
calculating exactly how long 'twill be in minutes afore
Dr. Hext can get up from Bridgetstowe."
</p>

<p>
"Us'll soon have <i>him</i> out, anyhow," said Hephzibah.
"Fetch down my grey shawl and black bonnet, and the
basket as you'll find in the corner of my bedroom, Susan.
All be there that's called for."
</p>

<p>
"One of the fore-handed ones, you," said Mr. Huggins
with admiration.
</p>

<p>
"I believe so," she answered.  "You've got to be
fore-handed in matters of body and soul, Valentine Huggins;
and them as ban't, get left behind in this world and forgot
in the next."
</p>

<p>
She kicked off her slippers and drew on a pair of elastic-sided
boots which stood by the fire.  Then Susan brought
her shawl and bonnet.
</p>

<p>
"Take the basket and I'll be after you," said Mrs. Weekes.
"And as for you, Philip, you'll do well to wash
up, bank the fire, put the kettle on the hob just near, to
catch heat without boiling, and then come across to Jarratt's
to see if there's anything I can set you upon.  And, for the
sake of pride, put a little more uprightness into your bearing.
You slouch like a bachelor&mdash;always have; and yet afore
another morning, if God so wills, you'll be a grandfather."
</p>

<p>
She whirled away, and the men were left alone.  Mr. Huggins
mopped his forehead.
</p>

<p>
"Lord, what a masterpiece among women!  Don't she
often bring the perspiration out on your brow?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Not now," answered Mr. Weekes.  "I'm long past that."
</p>

<p>
Towards night the market woman's prophecy came true,
and Philip was permitted to hold a granddaughter in his
arms.  The grandmother had saved the situation in her own
opinion, and she only returned home, utterly exhausted in
mind and body, at midnight.  But Philip was even later,
and the kitchen clock had rattled the hour of two before
he left his son and returned to his wife.  She slept heavily,
but he ventured to wake her.
</p>

<p>
"Thought you'd like to know they be going to call the
child 'Hephzibah,'" he said.
</p>

<p>
She uttered sleepy sounds.
</p>

<p>
"Jar's idea, I lay.  I'm glad."
</p>

<p>
"'Twas my idea&mdash;I would have it," answered Philip.
</p>

<p>
"Mary's prettier, however.  Better you hadn't interfered.
But there'll be plenty of others.  A long family they'll get,
mark me.  Don't you talk no more.  I'm three parts dead
to-night, and I wish you hadn't woke me."
</p>

<p>
He felt a wound and sighed.  He had expected a little
praise.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Sarah Jane was among the first who came to visit the
new mother.  She said many kind things of the child, spent
an hour with secret thoughts in the house where Hilary
Woodrow had lived, and then departed homeward again.
</p>

<p>
The day was stern and fresh.  Easterly winds blew over
the cradle of the New Year, and February had not thus far
emptied her usual libation upon the earth.  The Moor slept
in the colours of mourning, and the wind seemed to bite
into the very granite and shrivel up the humble life that
dwelt thereon.  Hazes hid the horizon, but the adjacent
hills stood darkly out, clean-cut against the steel-grey sky.
Lyd shrilled along her ways and beside the water a carrion
crow or two sat with feathers puffed out.  They rose heavily
as Sarah Jane approached to cross the stepping-stones.
Then, under Doe Tor, a man met her.  He was riding a
rough horse and bound for home; but now he stopped, and
turned, and went back a part of the way to Ruddyford
beside her.
</p>

<p>
"I've just been seeing Mary," she said.  "I'm sure
you're very fortunate.  Nobody never had a braver li'l
one."
</p>

<p>
"How are you?" he asked.  "Why, 'tis six months
since I've seed 'e&mdash;to speak to&mdash;or more."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, thank you."
</p>

<p>
"And your man and your youngster?"
</p>

<p>
"Well as possible."
</p>

<p>
He looked down at her and thought of the past, and
smiled to himself.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis funny to you, no doubt, being in my house again.
You must have missed Mr. Woodrow a bit, I should think."
</p>

<p>
"'Twas funny."
</p>

<p>
"What's the news of him?  Do you ever go down to
Dawlish to have a chat with him?"
</p>

<p>
Sarah Jane remembered that this man warned her husband
against Woodrow.  From that moment her attitude
towards him had changed.  And she had just heard another
thing from his wife.  Mary was anxious that Sarah Jane
should be her child's godmother and Jarratt refused to permit
it.  He gave no reasons, but explained that he wished
others to fill that position.  This fact Brendon's wife had
learned within the hour from her friend.
</p>

<p>
"Daniel and Mr. Prout go down from time to time and
bide a night or two.  I haven't," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Of course not.  Yet I'm sure you miss him."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do."
</p>

<p>
"I never could see much in the man myself."
</p>

<p>
"You wouldn't.  You'd never understand why anybody
could overpay you for your house.  To you that would be
a fool's trick.  No doubt you despise him for paying more
for a thing than 'twas worth."
</p>

<p>
He laughed and shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Oh no, Sarah Jane.  That didn't surprise me at all, I
assure you.  He had his reasons.  It suited&mdash;his health
very well.  'Twas money well spent from his point of view;
and well earned from mine.  A lucky man&mdash;a very lucky
man."
</p>

<p>
She disliked his tone with its suggestion of insolent
superiority.
</p>

<p>
He leant over and patted her shoulder, whereupon she
started indignantly away.
</p>

<p>
"Needn't be cross with me, my dear," he said.  "Why,
bless your life, I feel that intimate&mdash;however, since you're
not in an amiable mood seemingly, I'll go my way.  Give
my respects to Daniel.  He's calling out for rain, I
suppose."
</p>

<p>
She stopped and turned on him almost fiercely.
</p>

<p>
"Why for wouldn't you let me be godmother to your li'l
girl?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;that's it!  What the mischief did Mary want to
tell you that for?  No offence, no offence at all, and you
mustn't take it so.  The reason&mdash;and yet I'm not sure if
you'd understand.  You're so out of the common, you
know&mdash;such a large mind&mdash;so&mdash;how shall I put it now?
'Tis the difference betwixt you and your husband&mdash;the
difference in your way of thinking.  I'm a Christian man, Sarah
Jane; but you&mdash;I ban't quite sure that you're a Christian
woman; so all's said.  But don't be angry about it; and
don't tell Daniel, for 'twill only hurt his feelings, you see."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think it.  He can read me like print, and he
knows I'm a better pattern of Christian than what you be,
anyway.  'Tis a slight you've put on me&mdash;not that I care
a straw what you think of me."
</p>

<p>
He shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Why should you care?  But I wouldn't hurt you for
anything, Sarah Jane&mdash;much too fond of you for that.  I
know your virtues&mdash;nobody better.  If you'd like to be
god-mother, you shall, bless your large heart!  And don't try to
quarrel with me, because I'll never let you.  Them beautiful
eyes&mdash;they make the sky ashamed these cold days!"
</p>

<p>
He rode away before she could answer, and left her in
doubt of his meaning.  The words he said were nothing,
but the easy familiarity of his tone exasperated her.  She
determined with herself that now, even if pressed to be his
child's godmother, she would refuse.
</p>

<p>
And Jarratt Weekes, returning to Lydford, met another
of the Ruddyford folk.  He was passing with a nod, when
John Prout stopped him.  The ponies rubbed noses, and
then Prout turned and rode for a while beside the other.
</p>

<p>
"Funny I should chance on you," said Jarratt.  "I've
just been having speech along with Sarah Jane Brendon.
'Tis the salt of life to me to see that woman carry her lovely
head so high&mdash;knowing what I know."
</p>

<p>
"Weekes," answered the old man, "I want to pray
you by all that you hold sacred, by the prosperity that's
yours, by your wife and by your child, and by your God&mdash;yes,
by your God&mdash;to let this pass over.  Forget it you
can't&mdash;no more can I&mdash;but don't let it be a part of your life,
or your thoughts.  Don't let it enter into your mind, as
a thing to be used.  Which of us can live his whole life
with the blind up?  'Twas a fatal accident, and I'm not
saying a word against sin&mdash;my hair be the greyer for
it&mdash;but&mdash;oh, man, don't harbour it; don't hug it, for God's
sake&mdash;same as you be doing now.  I know&mdash;I know.  I
read it in your face every time you and me meet in company.
I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Stop," interrupted Weekes.  "You're wasting your
wind, Prout.  And you're quite mistaking me.  Everyone
of us, if we keep our eyes open, hoard a harvest in our
memories and collect all sorts of things gleaned up out of
the world.  Some of the gatherings may be useful, some
may not be useful.  You never know.  A man's memory
be like a woman's boxes&mdash;full of all sorts; and the wisest
man keeps all in order, so as he'll know where to put his
finger on anything if he wants it.  He may die without
using some of the things stored up&mdash;or he may find he
needs 'em in a hurry any minute.  That's how 'tis with
me."
</p>

<p>
"What sort of Christian be that who hoards what he
knows another creature would dearly wish destroyed?  You
mean to strike these people when the time comes and you
hunger for the chance to do it."
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit.  I'm in no hurry to roll 'em over, I do
assure you.  'Live and let live' is a very good motto.
And 'Let sleeping dogs lie' be another worth remembering.
But as to laughing at a good joke&mdash;that I always shall do.
And the cream of the joke is the fix you be in.  For if you
wasn't here, I should have no witness; but since you be
here, I can blow Brendon to the devil when I like.  'Tis
amusing in itself to feel so much stronger than that very
strong chap."
</p>

<p>
"He's never wronged you&mdash;more have they&mdash;her and
the master."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know that?"
</p>

<p>
"You'd never do it as a Christian man, Jarratt Weekes."
</p>

<p>
"As a Christian man I ought to do it.  'Twould be a
good Christian deed, surely, to let the light in on that
darkness, and so save the woman's soul alive.  But it
might be a tragical mess if it got out: that I'm free to
grant; and I've no intention whatever of saying a word.
I'm a very patient man, and can stand hard knocks as well
as most.  We'll wait and watch, and see what sort of
friend Brendon will be to me presently.  I've just offered
Sarah Jane to be my baby's gossip; so you see I don't
harbour no ill-will against the dear creature herself&mdash;who
could?  So long, and keep warm against this piercing wind.
Good men are scarcer every day, John Prout!"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Jarratt rode away, leaving in the old man's mind a deep
uneasiness, somewhat similar in quality to that he had
just awakened in the soul of Daniel Brendon's wife.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
THE FARMER COMES HOME
</h3>

<p>
Hilary Woodrow returned home during the latter part
of May, and Ruddyford rejoiced to see him.  But despite
his assurances, all found him a little changed.  He was
tolerably active and cheerful, yet thinner than of yore, and
his love of the saddle had decreased.  He rode abroad less
than formerly, and he read more; but he showed no
indifference to the minor questions of the passing hour.  Of
old, nothing was too small for him to bestow thought upon
it; and he still liked to be consulted as to the affairs of his
farm.
</p>

<p>
Yet in certain particulars it seemed that he had slightly
changed his attitude to most things.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis more like a visitor in the house, somehow, than
the master," said Peter Lethbridge to Daniel; and the other
admitted it.
</p>

<p>
"Too easy for a master now," he answered.  "'Tis a
very bad sign in my opinion, and I shall have a tell with
him about it."
</p>

<p>
He was as good as his word, and explained his uneasiness
in very clear language.
</p>

<p>
"I feel I'm largely the cause of this," he declared while
once they walked together homeward from the railway
station of Lydford.  "It hurts me terrible&mdash;'tis as though
you felt Ruddyford was gone already.  I wish to God you'd
burn them papers, and put dying out of your mind.  If I
may say so, you'm a man running to meet the end of life.
And you, please Heaven, with thirty years of usefulness
before you."
</p>

<p>
"I like you to say these things, Dan; because it shows
you're the same always.  You don't change.  I wish we
were all as steadfast.  But to be honest with you, I'm
come to a time when the rest of the road can be seen pretty
clear.  The things that make life worth living shrink very
small as soon as life ceases to be worth living."
</p>

<p>
"Life's worth living while we've got the power left to
think a good thought."
</p>

<p>
Woodrow did not answer for some time.  Then he said:
</p>

<p>
"I want you to go to Bristol for me next month.  Don't
think I've lost interest in my farm and my stock.  There's
a sale there of pedigree stuff, and I've ideas.  I'll buy three
beasts&mdash;a bull and two heifers."
</p>

<p>
"They'll cost a mint of money."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?"
</p>

<p>
Brendon rejoiced.
</p>

<p>
"A pity there ban't more with your great ideas on
Dartymoor.  The place is the best grazing ground in England,
yet who knows its worth?  I'll go, and gladly.  You must
put a limit on the purchases if 'tis an auction."
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you to-night, if you'll come in for an hour.
How's little Gregory this morning?"
</p>

<p>
Daniel's animation waned somewhat.
</p>

<p>
"Not all us could wish&mdash;fretful seemingly, and off his
food.  Sarah Jane be going to have doctor to him if he
ban't better next week."
</p>

<p>
"Don't put it off."
</p>

<p>
"He's growing that fast."
</p>

<p>
"A very good lad&mdash;more like you than his mother.  You'll
make a farmer of him, Daniel?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean to.  'Twas my hope us should have had another
boy to grow up with him&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Plenty of time."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
A month later Brendon started for Bristol.  It was a
great incident, and his wife and he felt much excited about
it.  She had so far seen but little of Hilary since his
return; now, during the three days' absence of Daniel, it
became possible to spend some hours in the master's
company.
</p>

<p>
By appointment they met in the old peat-works, but the
relation between them was different from of old.  Woodrow's
fever had departed with possession; his appetence
had quite faded.  Now he loved her, with all his soul rather
than with all his heart.  The words were his own, and she
questioned them.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a higher thing, no doubt, and I'm thankful you
feel so," she said.  "'Twill surely grow up so great in you
that all else will be forgot.  I wish I could see more of you,
and look to your comfort closer.  Tabitha's a kind woman,
but hard at the edges."
</p>

<p>
They sat in the great empty drum at the peat-works.
It was dry and littered with sweet fresh fern, for Sarah
Jane sometimes climbed thither to reflect and think upon the
dead, when leisure served.  She brought the child with her
to play in the peat, and liked to see him at his games,
because she knew that his grandfather would have loved the
sight.  On these occasions he was allowed to play with the
famous knife.  Then Sarah Jane hid it safely until their
next visit.
</p>

<p>
Where now they sat, she could see the little figure busy
with rusty tools that a man had used in earnest, though in
vain.  Upon Gregory Friend's death the last spark of
human life departed from Amicombe Hill, and now only
Nature worked there.
</p>

<p>
Woodrow reclined beside Sarah Jane, and stroked her
hand.  From time to time came the thud of a hoof, where
his horse was tethered close by.
</p>

<p>
"And yet," she said, "to hear you put your soul afore
your heart be a wonder, Hilary, for 'twas only a little time
agone that you'd have none of the word.  I be glad and
sorry both to hear you say it.  Glad because it makes you
a thought happier."
</p>

<p>
"Why sorry?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know&mdash;down deep in me I be.  Can't find a
word for it.  'Tis giving up something in my feeling to put
anything afore our bodies When I think of father, I see
his round shoulders and beard and shining eyes.  I'm so
small-minded, I can't fancy them I love save in their dear
flesh."
</p>

<p>
"You beautiful thing!  Well may you say it&mdash;such a
queen of the flesh as you are!  But for me 'tis different.
A pain-stricken wretch, sinking away back to the dust so
fast."
</p>

<p>
"Don't say that.  'Tis only your hands be thinner, because
you never use 'em save for turning the pages of books.  I
do wish you'd be on your horse more."
</p>

<p>
"I know&mdash;I know.  Man cannot live by books alone.
I'll do everything.  But think&mdash;what a great, precious
thought&mdash;to believe there's a time after!  Aren't you glad
I've got to believe that?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you believe it?"
</p>

<p>
"I do."
</p>

<p>
"I'll say no hard thing against your books no more then.
Somehow&mdash;after what fell out&mdash;I wanted to be the same
as you.  I was torn in half between Dan and you; and
sometimes I thought heaven would be good, and oftener I
couldn't see how.  Then I felt as if the sleep without end
and without dreams that you trusted to was best.  But if
you and Daniel both think for sure that there's a time
coming will find us alive for ever, and no growing old in
it&mdash;then I'll believe it too&mdash;I must."
</p>

<p>
"Believe it," he said.  "'Tis worth anything.  We call
death endless sleep and all the rest of it, to make it sound
less terrible; but that is only playing with words.  Death
is dust if it is the end.  I prayed to God&mdash;the God I didn't
believe in&mdash;to make me believe.  Such vain things will a
sad heart do.  Not vain either, for He heard and answered.
The sea it was that fetched the answer.  Miles and miles
I tramped along lonely shores and watched the waves.
They brought the idea of endlessness so near to me.  My
watch in my pocket ticked time; but the great, sad-coloured
waves beat out eternity.  I want to walk on that beach
with you and see the water-scythes sweep round and mow
the sand.  And when the sand sighs I feel it is the sigh of
the weary earth, that knows no rest from the unwearying
sea.  The sea's a better lover than I was.  Twice a day he
worships the shore."
</p>

<p>
"I might come maybe when autumn's back.  A change
would do the child good belike."
</p>

<p>
"Well thought.  What more natural?  Somehow I want
you there&mdash;just to walk over the sand and hear the long
sob and hopeless sigh of sea against stone.  It will force
you to believe in your soul, Sarah Jane."
</p>

<p>
"Do it make you glad&mdash;this new feeling?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it does.  It opens out so many doors to hope.
It teaches so much.  I told you once that if there was
another world, there was a God.  It is so."
</p>

<p>
"Do it make right and wrong plainer?"
</p>

<p>
"In time&mdash;in time it will.  I've flung over a lot of old
opinions already.  'Tis like parting with the very stuff of
your brain; for my thoughts were my life&mdash;till you came
into it.  But you&mdash;you've taught me such a lot too.  You
taught me that truth was beyond our reach&mdash;that was a
great piece of learning.  Once hold that and comfort grows
out of it&mdash;a sort of desolate comfort to a hungry heart&mdash;still
comfort.  Truth's got to be softened behind a veil for
things with no more intellect than we have.  The stark,
naked light would blind us for ever and make us mad.
God knows that.  Truth is God's face, Sarah Jane."
</p>

<p>
She was secretly amazed at this great mental change in
him.  For his sake she was glad, because he had evidently
welcomed the possibility of a new belief that was strong to
throw hope over the present desert of his mind.  With
weakened physical circumstances, reason had also weakened;
but Woodrow believed otherwise and told himself that
unimpaired intellectual powers, working unceasingly on the
problem he conceived to be paramount, had at last purged
his understanding and lifted him into a purer belief.  He
was, moreover, proud that he had attained to this triumph
by the exercise of what he believed to be pure reason.  He
doubted not that such faith as he had now attained was the
only faith worthy of mankind.
</p>

<p>
But in the woman's heart lurked something akin to regret.
She could not name the emotion; she lacked words to
analyze it; but she knew that it was there; and while her
nature leapt to gladness&mdash;because Hilary was glad&mdash;behind
the joy persisted something of disquiet and even distrust.
</p>

<p>
"I'll be well pleased to think like you do, then," she
said; "but&mdash;but, oh, Hilary, for God's sake don't you
grow to think like Daniel do&mdash;else&mdash;else&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Never fear that&mdash;that would be to go down the hill&mdash;not
up it.  It's cost the life-work of my brains to get where
I have got, dear heart.  I shan't go backward now."
</p>

<p>
Presently she left Woodrow and went to her child.  Then
Gregory and his mother set off homeward.
</p>

<p>
The farmer watched them sink&mdash;a large spot and a little
one&mdash;into the waste.  Presently he rose and mounted his
horse.  He thought long upon Sarah Jane and that last
note of fear&mdash;so foreign to her fearless voice.  He reflected,
too, upon his own altered attitude and sublimated affection
for her.  He supposed that belief in immortality must be
a force very elevating to the human mind; he doubted not
that it lifted glorious flowers when once the root struck
down and flourished.  He considered the great matter from
divers points of view, but not from one.  He did not know
that decaying physical circumstances frequently open the
door to superstition and make a fading intellect succumb
before what, in full vigour of intellectual life, it scorned.
</p>

<p>
The day chimed with his mood, and he told himself very
honestly that none could gaze upon this outspread world
and believe that it represented but a display of natural laws,
a casual compact of heat and light and substance, a chance
conglobation of matter whirling beautifully about the sun's
throne at the moment of summer solstice.
</p>

<p>
The light of noon shone over the world.  Cloud shadows
flew along the silvery planes of the earth's surface, and
life teemed in a myriad shapes even to the pinnacles of the
land.  Day herself scarcely died now, and night was a
shadow rather than a darkness.  Even in the midnight
watches, light, like a ghost, stole under the stars and behind
the northern hills until day returned.  So spirits might
haunt the nether gloom, he fancied, ere they vanished again
at the glorious advent of day.
</p>

<p>
To Woodrow, gazing upon the June world, it seemed
that he was the only faulty thing in the visible universe;
and he longed to cast his slough and also be without fault.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br><br>
THE FRUIT OF FAITH
</h3>

<p>
Matters fell out much as Hilary Woodrow desired.  He
returned to Dawlish in October, and soon afterwards
Brendon brought his wife and child to the sea.
</p>

<p>
His master and he took long walks together among the
Haldon hills, and Daniel learnt with enormous satisfaction
that the other had of late experienced great changes of
spirit.  The big man gloried in this fact from a personal
point of view, because it appeared to justify his immense
faith in prayer.  He had petitioned Heaven for Hilary
Woodrow; and here dawned the answer.  Daniel doubted
not that this was the beginning of a larger and deeper
conversion.  He urged Woodrow to go farther.
</p>

<p>
"There's no standing still," he said.  "There's no
standing still for you now&mdash;no more than the light stands
still when the sun rises.  Brighter and brighter surely it
must grow, till the full light of the Gospel of the Son of
God warms your heart.  Man! what's deeper than that,
what shows all clearer than that&mdash;or throws a darker
shadow&mdash;the shadow of our sins?"
</p>

<p>
"What a preacher you are!"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis the good tidings of what you say.  They make
even my slow mind move quick.  'Ye believe in God,
believe also in Me'; 'tis that I'm thinking."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Dan, that's a very different matter."
</p>

<p>
"God'll show you 'tis the same."
</p>

<p>
Thus oftentimes they talked; then work called Brendon,
and he went home again.  But his wife and child stopped
for some weeks longer beside the sea; because little Gregory
gained benefit from the change, and Sarah Jane was anxious
to remain for his sake.
</p>

<p>
The old-time fires were now banked deep in Daniel's
mind under the changes and chances of his life.  Jealous
he was, since a large power of jealousy pertained to his
nature; but for Woodrow he had long since failed to feel
anything but the staunch devotion of a brother.  Apart from
this emotion, awakened by the circumstance of the farmer's
personal goodness to him, another far deeper, begot of
natural instinct, told him that Hilary was harmless now.
Whatever his attitude towards Sarah Jane had been, the
very openness of their friendship and the close intimacy
of their conversation under his own eyes and before his
own ears, had convinced the husband that no shadow of
danger existed in their relations.  The past in truth was
dead enough, and Brendon, a man of clean mind, despite
jealousy, made the mistake of supposing that it had never
been.  He went further and, looking backward, blamed
himself for an unseemly attitude, and confessed his sin to
his Maker.
</p>

<p>
The past was dead, and neither Hilary nor Sarah Jane,
as they walked together at the edge of the winter sea,
sought or thought upon its grave.  Far otherwise, she
found that in the light of his new opinions he could now
bitterly mourn the past.  On a grey day, when a slight shore
wind smoothed the water and the sea was almost of the
same colour as the gulls that floated upon it, the man and
woman sat under shelter of a red cliff, talked together, and
watched Sarah Jane's child gathering cowry shells upon the
beach.
</p>

<p>
"How your husband rejoices in his God!  Have you
marked it, Sarah Jane?  Such a trust and such a great, live
gratitude underlying his scrupulous obedience."
</p>

<p>
"Well he may be grateful."
</p>

<p>
"I'm only a child in knowledge of the divine idea.
He's got far beyond that.  And yet&mdash;sometimes&mdash;I wonder
what would happen to his religion&mdash;and to us&mdash;if he
knew."
</p>

<p>
"I don't wonder.  I know what would happen.  He
might be sorry after&mdash;when 'twas too late&mdash;but while the
storm was raging in his heart, God's self wouldn't hold
him."
</p>

<p>
"I understand."
</p>

<p>
"And I wouldn't blame him neither.  Think&mdash;the solid
earth giving way under his feet.  'Twould be no less to
him."
</p>

<p>
"It's very awful&mdash;considered in that manner.  I hope
you're wrong."
</p>

<p>
"The sea would be weak and the rocks would be soft
compared to him."
</p>

<p>
"You've never felt he ought to know?"
</p>

<p>
She gasped and stared.
</p>

<p>
"My God!  No, I haven't."
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes I have, Sarah Jane."
</p>

<p>
Her eyes rested on him in profound and horrified amazement.
</p>

<p>
"You can say that!  Believing in God has brought you
to that!  Then I wish you'd never come to it, Hilary
Woodrow."
</p>

<p>
"I have almost felt that if I lived very much longer, I
might tell him."
</p>

<p>
"You won't live much longer afterwards, if you do.
He's said to me in naked words, that 'tis no sin to kill
them as have done what we have done.  His Bible is behind
him."
</p>

<p>
"Nevertheless, if you were dead, I should tell Brendon."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not dead, and I don't want to die.  You&mdash;you to
say this awful thing to me!  I feel as if I was going mad.
I can't believe it.  I won't believe 'tis you talking.
You&mdash;knowing all you know!"
</p>

<p>
Something akin to indignation trembled in her voice; and
he marked it and felt shame.
</p>

<p>
"The thought came to me in a dream," he declared.
"Of course it's unthinkable awake.  But I wanted to hear
how it would sound."
</p>

<p>
She was much moved.
</p>

<p>
"It sounds like a bell tolling," she said.  "You grow
to be such an own-self man now&mdash;along of finding God, I
suppose.  You think to tell Brendon would ease your soul,
no doubt.  But what about his?  You've come to reckon
that you did wrong&mdash;that I did wrong&mdash;but can't you see
what might be rest to your mind is hell for his?  Don't
you know him well enough to know what it would mean
to him?  I can see the things that would happen&mdash;like a
row of awful&mdash;&mdash;there, you've made my brain whirl; you've
throwed me into a maze of terror for that man."
</p>

<p>
The other noticed that not a thought of fear for herself
influenced Sarah Jane.  Neither did she concern her mind
with him after his confession.  Her husband filled her
heart.
</p>

<p>
Hilary pacified her and quite agreed with her; he laughed
at her fervour and declared that his God and her husband's
were as different as love from hate; that his God was hers,
not Daniel's.  She made no answer; but the reflection
that even from the fantasies of a dream he could pluck
such an idea and utter it in her ears, transformed her feeling
towards him from that hour for ever.  The shock of this
experience aged the spirit within her.  She returned home
at the appointed time; and was glad to be home.  But her
mental life had changed.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
PHILIP FALLS
</h3>

<p>
Philip Weekes considered that all men might be divided
into two classes: those who knew their own minds, and
those who did not.  His wife and son both belonged to
the smaller category; himself he numbered with the majority
and confessed that there were occasions when he found
himself not in two minds, but twenty.
</p>

<p>
With winter, Fate passing through Lydford, perceived
the amazing prosperity of all who bore the famous local
name of Weekes, and from her bitter lemon squeezed a
little verjuice.  Jarratt experienced some bad fortune and
lost more than he could afford to lose in a copper mine on
the east side of the Moor; while Philip himself fell ill.  It
was the attitude of Mrs. Weekes at the time of this latter
unparalleled misfortune that served so greatly to bewilder
the huckster.  He had fought against his indisposition
valiantly and only retired upon medical compulsion; but it
was quite as much fear of the consequences, if he went to
bed, as a valiant indifference to physical misery that kept
him on his legs until the last moment.
</p>

<p>
He drove Mrs. Weekes to Lydford station as usual on
a market day, and then returned home, feeling exceedingly
unwell.  A doctor called twice weekly at the village, and
fortunately he might be seen at his surgery upon Saturdays.
When Hephzibah came back her son Jarratt was waiting
with the pony-trap, and she learnt the amazing news that
the master was ill in bed.
</p>

<p>
"Guy Fawkes and good angels!" cried Mrs. Weekes.
"Philip down!  Push the pony along for the love of the
Lord, Jar.  Who's with him?"
</p>

<p>
"Mary runs in and out, and Susan, and Mrs. Taverner
have been very kind."
</p>

<p>
"Poor lamb! poor helpless lamb!" said the wife.
</p>

<p>
Ever in extremes, she now poured forth a torrent of
praise and extolled the immense virtues of Philip.  She also
dwelt on his practical value and her own imperishable
affection and admiration for him.
</p>

<p>
"Such men go down to the grave with nobody but God
Almighty and their wives to mark them," she said.
</p>

<p>
"'Twill be a case of 'Well done, thou good and faithful
servant' if he goes.  But it mustn't be.  It shan't be!"
</p>

<p>
"He's not in the least danger, mother."
</p>

<p>
"Danger!&mdash;how can you dare to use the word?  Oh, my
God, to think of the staff and prop of my life tottering&mdash;and
me not there!  'Danger'!&mdash;you ought to be a better
son than to say it.  Why for wasn't a telegram sent off?
What do Mary know of sickness?"
</p>

<p>
Jarratt grunted.
</p>

<p>
"If she don't, she's a fool then.  Another child coming
and the first always got something wrong with it."
</p>

<p>
"There&mdash;to think&mdash;that poor martyr!  I knowed there
was something wrong&mdash;felt it in my bones all yesterday.
'God send Mary's all right,' I said again and again to myself
in market.  But little did I think of master.  I fancied
'twas no more than just a running at the nose&mdash;and all the
time he was suffering agonies, no doubt.  The bravery of
the man!  Lash the pony, can't 'e, or I'll get out and
go afoot.  How long are we to take?  I'm itching to be
at him!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Weekes soon reached home, and swiftly swept the
neighbours out of the house.
</p>

<p>
"He'm asking for you, Aunt Hepsy," said Susan.
"He'm very peaceful, with his medicine, an' a Bible, an'
the kettle 'pon the fire; and blacksmith have made a proper
long spout for the kettle as the doctor ordained, so the steam
can get to him."
</p>

<p>
"You go off, you chattering magpie," began Mrs. Weekes;
then she hastened up to the head of the house,
and found him pretty comfortable, but very crestfallen and
full of the humblest apologies.
</p>

<p>
"Awful sorry," he croaked.  "I blush for myself, I'm sure."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you talk&mdash;not a word.  I'll do the talking for
once, you poor fallen creature!  It do tear me to pieces to
see you thrust into your bed, in the full vigour of manhood,
like this.  And never a groan&mdash;you valiant boy!  But now
I be back, us shall soon have 'e on your feet again.  You
trust to me!  Be you easy?  Where's the pain?  I'd
sooner fight evils above the navel than below it, as I have
always maintained.  Don't say 'tis the stomach&mdash;don't say
that.  But your poor cracked voice tells me all I want to
know."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis the breathing parts, my dear."
</p>

<p>
"And you brave as an army about it, and never told me,
and let me desert you without a thought.  You wonderful
man!  I wish to God there was more like you.  Let me
look in your face.  Good!  Don't you fear any harm,
Philip.  While the white of your eye be so clear, there's no
danger.  You'll come through all right."
</p>

<p>
"No danger, I'm sure.  I can drink soup as easy as
anything.  But 'tis the ill-convenience of upsetting the
bedroom so."
</p>

<p>
"Like your big mind to think of it; but what's a
bedroom to me?  I don't want no bedroom while you'm
stricken down.  Not a wink of sleep shall I have, till doctor
says you can rise up again.  And to think I never guessed,
so quiet you kept it!  When Jar showed hisself at the
station&mdash;even then I didn't seem to know what had kept you.
'Where's that beetle of a man, Philip Weekes?' I asked,
in my brisk, cheerful way.  'Struck down,' says Jarratt;
and you could have flung me into the air.  I was blowed
out with sudden terror, like a balloon."
</p>

<p>
"I did ought to have a bowl of something to lap at about
mid-day, according to doctor's orders&mdash;not that I want it
if 'twill be troubling you," said Mr. Weekes.
</p>

<p>
"So you shall, then; an' the fat of the land shall you
have, as becomes such a man; an' wine, if I've got to sell
my shoes for it&mdash;good, black port wine&mdash;as good as Noah
Pearn have got in the house&mdash;you shall drink&mdash;bottles and
bottles&mdash;till your very blood be wine!  There's nought
makes blood like what port does."
</p>

<p>
She set to work from that moment and toiled unceasingly
until Mr. Weekes had passed the crisis of his illness, and
was pronounced convalescent.  Then she nearly fed him
to death, praised God for His mercies, and wearied the whole
street of Lydford with nursing details, with symptoms and
their treatment, with the particulars of diet, with enthusiastic
comments on the majestic attitude of mind preserved
by Philip throughout his sufferings.
</p>

<p>
Presently neighbours called, and were allowed to have
speech with the invalid.  Philip's eyes had been giving him
some trouble, and during his illness the doctor had
prescribed a pair of glasses.  These were now made, and
Mr. Weekes was proud of them, and pleased with the
appearance of himself in them.  Adam Churchward visited him,
and admired his spectacles.
</p>

<p>
"It brings out the natural thoughtful bent of your
countenance, if I may say so.  You'll find them a great comfort
and support without a doubt.  For my part, strange though
it may seem, I have to put on my glasses now&mdash;not only to
see with, but to think with.  My mind refuses to move
freely until I feel them on the bridge of my nose."
</p>

<p>
"It clears print something wonderful," explained Philip,
"and of late, for want of power to do anything useful, I've
sunk down to reading the newspaper, and found it very
interesting.  I've had a good dash at the Word too; and
'tis curious to see that fighting was just as bloody a job in
Old Testament days as it be now.  The only difference is
that then they always knowed which side the Lord was,
afore they went to war; and now we never know till
afterwards.  If the Almighty took the same pleasure in England
as He done in Israel, we should just walk over the earth."
</p>

<p>
"A very wise remark," declared Mr. Churchward; "I
can see the glasses are steadying your mind already."
</p>

<p>
"He be so vain of 'em as a turkey-cock," said
Mrs. Weekes, who sat beside her husband's bed.  Why, it
minds me of the time Jarratt was born.  Then the airs
and graces this man give himself!  'Twas every minute,
'Where's my son?  Where's my boy Jarratt to?'  And
now 'tis 'Where's my glasses?'  'Here, let me get on my
glasses!'
</p>

<p>
"I like a middle-aged face to look wise," declared
Mr. Churchward.  "There's no more shameful thing in nature
than an elderly fool.  Yet one meets them&mdash;people over
whose heads life has passed and not brought a single
thoughtful line.  Poor, smooth-faced souls!  Why, the very
beasts that perish as doth the grass of the field look wiser,
and undoubtedly are wiser, as they grow older."
</p>

<p>
"No good growing old if you don't grow artful, for
certain," said Mrs. Weekes.  "And another thing is that
they fools are far more harmful than the knaves.  A knave
makes clean work, but a fool botches all.  Everybody knows
that.  Why, you men&mdash;Lord bless you!&mdash;I see through the
pack of you, like windows!"
</p>

<p>
"You do your best, as I do, to inculcate wisdom,"
answered the schoolmaster.  "For my part I may say that
I leave no stone unturned to implant it in the rising
generation.  Sow enough seed and some will undoubtedly
germinate in a satisfactory manner.  We never know how great a
matter may be kindled by a flash of sense bursting in upon
the youthful mind.  And, in your case, you don't deny
your immense fund of common sense to the humblest who
asks for it.  I suppose that nobody in Lydford gives more
good advice in the course of a twelvemonth than you do,
Mrs. Weekes.  Nathaniel Spry is sound also."
</p>

<p>
"Him!" returned Hephzibah with contempt.  "What
does he know, more than how many penny stamps make
twelve, or how to weigh a parcel, or write a gun license?
How can he know anything, living out his life behind the
counter in that stuffy little post-office?"
</p>

<p>
"I was going to admit that his experience of the world
is rather limited; but he is a great reader, and has nourished
his intellect on the learning of wiser men than himself.  His
advice generally comes out of a good book, and is therefore
pretty well to be relied upon."
</p>

<p>
"As to advice," she answered.  "'Tis taking it, not
giving it that matters.  If a man or woman agrees with
you, and falls in with every word, and thanks you over
and over again&mdash;then you may feel perfectly sure they won't
follow a syllable and have only come to waste your time.
'Tis them that argue, and wrangle, and sulk, and ax your
reasons, and go away in a temper with you&mdash;'tis them that
be most likely to profit by what you've said."
</p>

<p>
A voice cried from below stairs.
</p>

<p>
"Can Valentine come up to see father?"
</p>

<p>
"He can," answered Mr. Weekes; and a moment later
old Huggins creaked upstairs, followed by Jarratt.
</p>

<p>
"You'd better go, schoolmaster.  You've had your turn,"
said Hephzibah.  "Philip mustn't see too much company
all at once."
</p>

<p>
Adam, therefore, withdrew, and Mr. Huggins took his
place.
</p>

<p>
"I heard the joyful news as you was your own man
again, and soon to come down house," said the patriarch;
"therefore nothing would do but what I must walk up and
have a look at you.  Not changed a hair, thank God."
</p>

<p>
"He's fatter," said Mrs. Weekes.  "The idleness have
put flesh on him&mdash;round as a tub he have grown.  You'm
inches deep in lard, ban't you, my old dear?"
</p>

<p>
"I believe I am," answered Philip.  "But I'll work it
off again so soon as I get on my legs.  It shows how little
us be wanted, Val, that though we may be struck down,
the world goes on just the same.  Now I've often thought,
in my vainglorious way, what would become of all my
Indian game birds if anything happened to me.  Yet they
was never better, and be laying as free as Nature can make
'em, so missis tells me."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis this here wonderful woman," said Huggins.
"You'm one of the fortunates, you are.  'Be dashed if
Hephzibah Weekes don't know how to be in two places to
once!' I said not long since to Noah Pearn.  And he
answered 'twas the cleverest thing he'd ever heard me say."
</p>

<p>
"Philip's going to be let out of bed to-morrow," said
Mrs. Weekes.  "And he'll come down house the day
after."
</p>

<p>
"The spring weather will soon set him up."
</p>

<p>
"Spring be here without a doubt," she answered.  "That
dear angel boy of Sarah Jane's comed in along with his
father yester-eve; and he fetched as fine a bunch of primrosen
as you could wish to see.  But the darling had picked
'em without stalks, as childer will, so they was flinged away
so soon as his li'l back was turned."
</p>

<p>
"A very promising start to the year, I do think," said
Mr. Huggins.  "A good deal of prosperity in the country,
and very great promise of hay&mdash;so John Prout tells me."
</p>

<p>
"What was the news of Mr. Woodrow?"
</p>

<p>
"I named him.  He've wintered pretty well&mdash;ban't worse
nor better.  Daniel Brendon be going down to him for a few
days, and 'tis hoped he'll come home first week in June."
</p>

<p>
"Good luck all round, then."
</p>

<p>
"You forget me," said Jarratt, who had been standing
with his hands in his pockets, looking out of the window.
"But one man's ill-fortune don't matter, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
"I heard as Wheal Cosdon was looking up again,"
answered Mr. Huggins.
</p>

<p>
"You heard wrong.  'Tis as like as not 'twill be knacked
in autumn.  'Twas a damned swindle; but they promoters
be on the windy side o' the law, as usual, and us, who put
in our hard-earned savings, get nought."
</p>

<p>
"Can't you have the law of nobody about it?" asked
his father.
</p>

<p>
"No, I can't.  The rogues be safe enough.  The law's
their side."
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to poison the traitors with the arsenic they've
digged out of the place," cried Hephzibah.  "To steal the
bread from the mouths of men and women and children;
and eat it themselves&mdash;the anointed robbers!  'Tis a
shameful thing to think in a Christian land the laws should all
be made with an eye to the comfort of the rich."
</p>

<p>
"Can't be otherwise&mdash;so long as the rich make 'em,"
ventured Philip.
</p>

<p>
"With all your natural needs and requirements in the
big life you lead, it must be a terrible crash to have to put
down your servant, as they tell me you think of doing,"
said Huggins to Jarratt Weekes.
</p>

<p>
"I must face it.  I like ease and comfort as well as
anybody&mdash;especially since I earned it by my own hard
work.  But we must cut the coat as the cloth allows.
Ban't no good thirsting for half a pint, if you haven't got
three-halfpence."
</p>

<p>
Valentine, however, doubted the philosophy of this sentiment.
</p>

<p>
"Don't say so.  You'm leaving out of your reckoning all
the Good Samaritans that be about the world, and the beauty
of human nature in general."
</p>

<p>
"Human nature's all rot.  Anyway, it isn't the thirsty
folks that human nature asks to drink."
</p>

<p>
"Yet I've had scores and scores gratis and for nothing
in my time," declared Mr. Huggins.  "Eighty year old
am I, and if I could tell 'em up, I make no doubt that
I should find I'd had barrels over one counter and another&mdash;all
out of the goodness of my fellow-creatures, without a
thought of any return.  Not but what I haven't stood
oceans of drink in my time too.  But gratitude's the thing&mdash;an'
rarer even than generosity.  I'm exceedingly grateful
for all the free beer I've had, and I won't hear you tell that
human nature's rot, just because you are a bit under the
weather.  Your luck will come uppermost presently&mdash;then
you'll think different."
</p>

<p>
"Good sense, Val.  Cheer him up if you can," said
Mrs. Weekes.  "And now you men had best to get off, for
Philip must have his dinner."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br><br>
A CHRISTIAN CONVERT
</h3>

<p>
With another summer Hilary Woodrow again returned to
his home, and time passed as during previous years.  But
the passage of the last winter had left its mark upon him,
and the least observant noticed a change.  Physically he
had grown thinner.  His cheek-bones thrust out, and there
were hollows beneath them.  He still rode, and he still
read; but his books belonged now to a different plane of
thought, and a man by glancing at them might have
calculated with pretty close accuracy the nature of his bent,
and the slow but sure victory of faith over reason.
</p>

<p>
In some respects he looked younger, for a colour that
means health in infancy and death at adolescence, lighted
his fallen cheek.  His eyes were bright; his manner continued
courteous and kind as of yore; his energies were not
yet much decreased, save in certain directions.  From
predisposition he had gradually passed into actual disease; and
as the bodily fires waned and cooled, his interest in the
superhuman waxed and dominated every waking hour.  He
believed in a life beyond the grave; he had infected the
domain of reason by deep reading of irrational authors; and
these created an atmosphere through which he groped his
way back to the faith of his fathers.
</p>

<p>
Sarah Jane held secret speech with him, at oncoming
of another autumn, and the great matter arose upon his
lips.  This happened towards the end of his stay at home,
when already it became necessary to think of leaving the
Moor.  First he treated of his health, and confessed, to
her grief, that he was not so well; then he discussed the
superstitions now supremely precious to him.
</p>

<p>
"What will you say when I tell you that I have followed
in the path of many and many a greater man than myself,
and changed my opinions?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I know it," she answered.  "You told me nine months
agone at Dawlish.  You believe in God and heaven; and
so do I with all my heart."
</p>

<p>
"But I've gone beyond that&mdash;higher&mdash;higher.  We must
believe in that, when our eyes are opened to read the meaning
of the world&mdash;or even a glimpse of the meaning.  Looking
back, I tremble to see what a dreadful, lonely thing I
was&mdash;walking here in my pride.  But God's too great a thought
for the mind of man to grasp single-handed.  I've come to
see there must be something between&mdash;something within
reach of human intellect&mdash;something that man's mind can
understand and even love&mdash;something that will bring the
divine light to us, yet soften its wonder and terror, so that
we can gaze upon it.  Without Christ, the idea of God
dazzles and blinds and bewilders.  With Christ, the thought
can be received and taken home into our hearts.  The only
possible God for man is made clear to us by the Son of
God.  Therefore I am a Christian, Sarah Jane."
</p>

<p>
Frank but fleeting anxiety filled her eyes as they opened
widely to regard him.  Great excitement was manifested
by Hilary.  An expression she had never seen there shone
in his countenance as he spoke.  It was the same light that
she knew as a familiar beacon upon her husband's face;
but there it glowed steady and flameless; here it shot up
and played like fire.
</p>

<p>
"You believe all that my Dan believes?"
</p>

<p>
"All.  Oh, Sarah Jane, the grief of it is greater than the
joy; for who, when the light comes, but must look back
as well as forward?  If I could only look forward!  But a
man in my case sees the past clear enough&mdash;clearer and
clearer as the sun sets upon it.  My sun-setting will be
stormy now.  I should have died happy enough with the
glorious thought of you and the past; but now 'tis just that
thought that will darken all."
</p>

<p>
"Can't you forget?  The years and years it was ago!
The scores and scores of things that have happened
since."
</p>

<p>
"I can't forget.  I lament it&mdash;I lament for it with my
whole heart and soul.  I mourn it waking and moan for it
sleeping.  I'd die a hundred deaths if the time could come
again."
</p>

<p>
"This be Christianity?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; it shows that I have not deceived myself.  I am
a Christian&mdash;therefore this thing that I have done torments
me."
</p>

<p>
"How it festers in your mind!  I've forgot it&mdash;very
near.  Many a dream that I dream seems more real to me
than that."
</p>

<p>
"It's the only reality left in my life."
</p>

<p>
"Then I wish you'd die quick and be at peace," she said
fiercely.  "I love you so dear that I can wish that for
you!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm dying fast enough&mdash;yet not fast enough.  I'm
impatient now to see what mercy means&mdash;mercy and
forgiveness.  I shall know soon.  How clear the stages are,
Sarah Jane!  I wonder if they are so clear with you?  First
joy and pride in what I'd done; then content and a blessed
memory to look back upon; then, as disease got hold of me,
and I had to begin to fight for life, clouds came between me
and the past.  Then the first sharp twinge of regret, as my
soul began to waken; then sorrow; then frantic, undying
grief and a vain agony of longing that I'd not sinned so
damnably against those I loved best in the world.  Have
you felt so, Sarah Jane?"
</p>

<p>
"Never," she said.  "I wept fire for a week after; I
was half raving for joy and half raving for misery&mdash;mad
like.  Then I put it all behind me.  Things stronger than
me&mdash;or you&mdash;worked that deed.  I'll pay the price, if I
must.  I didn't do it for myself&mdash;you know that."
</p>

<p>
"Can't you feel for my sufferings?"
</p>

<p>
At the bottom of her heart flashed a passing scorn;
but she expelled it and blamed only his unhappy physical
decay.
</p>

<p>
"'Twill all be made up if what you think is right.  Your
Christ will be so pleased with you for being sorry, that He'll
forgive you everything&mdash;and me too.  We sinners are His
sort.  The just persons go into heaven without any fuss, by
all accounts.  'Tis such as we are&mdash;weak, wicked,
good-for-noughts&mdash;that the angels will blow their trumpets for."
</p>

<p>
Hilary was astonished at her attitude and its satire&mdash;the
more terrible because quite unconscious.
</p>

<p>
"What would Daniel say to that?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," she answered.  "And I don't care."
</p>

<p>
Then her outlook utterly changed at a breath.
</p>

<p>
"Yet that's folly, if justice be anything," she continued.
"And I do care&mdash;care with all my might.  'Tis the like
of Daniel&mdash;pure in heart and soul, the faithful servant of
his God, that must go in first.  And so he should.  If
heaven's waiting, 'tis Dan and my dear, dear father, and
such as them&mdash;not me and you&mdash;will be put first.  'Tis
for their sakes I ever think or care about it, or want to go
there.  For their sakes.  But for them and my little boy,
I'd sooner go nowhere.  I've had nearly enough of living
anywhere&mdash;beautiful though 'tis to be alive.  I don't want
much more of it&mdash;not now you've said this to me."
</p>

<p>
"May you live long&mdash;very, very long&mdash;long enough to
forgive me."
</p>

<p>
"You needn't say things like that," she answered.
"The more you heap all this misery on your own head,
the less I'm likely to blame you.  I never did&mdash;not even
in thought, 'Twould have been a coward's part.  'Twas
no more than a bitter bargain, when all's said."
</p>

<p>
"How can you have the heart to speak so?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I ban't the religious creature you are, I suppose.
Let the dead past be&mdash;or you'll fret yourself to death
afore your time."
</p>

<p>
"Daniel is never out of my thoughts.  Sometimes I feel
almost as though I could fling myself on the ground at his
feet and, for my peace of mind, tell all."
</p>

<p>
"So you said last year, and made my heart stand still.
Yet 'tis a cruel, selfish wish&mdash;even for a full-blown new
Christian, I should reckon.  I loathed you for it at the
time, and my thoughts choked me to think as a man who&mdash;to
think such a wish could come to you.  But now I'm
changed too.  'Tis all one to me what you do, so far as I'm
concerned, and I'd tell Dan myself, if he was anything but
what he is.  Not for fear of him do I keep dumb&mdash;God He
knows that&mdash;but for love of him.  For great love of his
dear self I want the past to be dead and buried.  If it would
better Dan to tell it, I'd tell it; if my death would help
his life and his power of goodness, and fix him any stronger
and surer with heaven, I'd die laughing.  But what would
hap to him if he knew?  Would it bring him nearer to his
God?  No&mdash;worse luck: I'd be casting down his God and
leaving him stripped of everything he cares for and clings
to.  You know what he'd do&mdash;if you have spared a thought
from yourself for him."
</p>

<p>
The man winced.
</p>

<p>
"I deserve that," he said.  "You're right enough.  I
shall die with this on my conscience.  I shall die, and trust
Christ to do the rest&mdash;for you and him&mdash;and even for me."
</p>

<p>
He left her then, and passed down from the high ground
on which they had walked and talked.  Her little boy picked
whortleberries and filled a can with them not far off.
Woodrow was on foot, and now he sank into the valley.  She
rose and stood perched on the stone crown of a hill&mdash;stood
with fluttering skirt and lifting bosom, to drink in the great
wind that panted overhead from its strife with the Atlantic.
Mist swept here and there, and Hilary Woodrow was presently
obliterated by grey vapours that drove against the
hills, and broke along them, like waves upon a shore.
</p>

<p>
All that was most precious of this man had already died
to Sarah Jane.  What remained went ghostly, shadowy as
the grey vapour winding at her feet.  He had slain himself
before her eyes, and she mourned for him, and dumbly
wondered at the dreadful change.  Was it only the evil-doer
who trembled?  So did not Dan face his destiny.  But
Dan's heart and hands were clean.  She asked herself
what she believed; and she waived the subject as a thing
altogether indifferent.  Her soul was centred upon her
husband and his good.  She knew now that she wished
Hilary to die.  She looked straight and fearless upon her
own desire, and did not flinch from it.  Death would end
his tribulations and bring him peace; and his death must
prevent the haunting possibility of the past from ever falling
upon her husband's ear.
</p>

<p>
She went home presently, and was heartened on the way
by little Gregory's prattle and happiness.  His berries were
to make a pudding for dear Aunt Tab, and nobody else was
to eat of that pudding.
</p>

<p>
Presently Tabitha Prout received the gift with immense
gratitude, and promised faithfully that she would make a
pudding and eat every bit of it herself.  The child grew
more and more like his father.  He was spoiled by all but
Daniel, and his little tyrannies brought merriment to
Ruddyford, where life did not stand still.
</p>

<p>
Brendon without question now took command and stood
in his master's stead.  What he held good to do was done.
The old order changed steadily.  Further land had been
taken from the wilderness; larger flocks and herds roamed
the summer Moor; new cattle-byres rose; success attended
the homestead, and content dwelt therein.  Prout's
work was now as much or little as he cared to make it,
and when Woodrow abode at Dawlish, the old man spent a
good deal of time there and insisted on being his
body-servant.  Another labourer had been engaged at the farm,
and the rest of the men remained, save Joe Tapson.  Him
Daniel reluctantly dismissed, since rheumatism in the
shoulder had spoiled his usefulness.  He left in a bitter
mood, and though Brendon found him work, showed hate
rather than gratitude.  Sarah Jane was still dairymaid;
Tabitha still controlled the internal economy of the farm.
</p>

<p>
Much speculation was rife as to the real relations of
Woodrow and Daniel Brendon.  Those interested guessed
at a bargain, and foresaw that the latter would ere long take
over Ruddyford; but the truth none knew, save only John
Prout, the Brendons, and Hilary himself.
</p>

<p>
Prout was indifferent, and troubled little about his own
old age.  That he trusted to Daniel, as he had trusted it
to his master.  Indeed, he made no leisure for more than
grief.  He knew now that Woodrow must presently die,
and the fact darkened his days, for he greatly loved him.
</p>

<p>
As for small Gregory, his attractive behaviour continued
to appeal to Mrs. Weekes, who hesitated not to set him up
above her own grandchild.  The circumstance annoyed her
son a good deal; but now had come an addition to Jarratt's
family, so interesting, that he expected Hephzibah would
forget Brendon's child before the wonder of the new arrivals.
For, succeeding upon some further bad fortune, the man's
wife bore twin boys, and the parents and grandparents found
themselves uncertain whether to welcome or deplore such a
sudden increase of responsibility.  Finally the grandparents
rejoiced, but the father and mother resented their cheerful
and sanguine view, and thought themselves ill-used.
</p>

<p>
The matter formed subject for a serious debate at the
Castle Inn on a Saturday night, and several of those
personally interested contributed to the discussion.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis very well for you to be so gay," said Jarratt to
his father, who was much pleased with the twins.  "You're
like t'other man in the corner there."  He pointed to
Mr. Churchward.  "To hear you two old fools, one would
think you'd both been left a legacy.  If you're so jolly
pleased with 'em, you'd better each take one.  You're
welcome."
</p>

<p>
He pulled at his beer gloomily.
</p>

<p>
"You oughtn't to speak so," answered the miller, Jacob
Taverner.  "You'd be sorry presently if the Lord took
them.  Then you'd look back at such bitter words in a very
different spirit."
</p>

<p>
"That I certainly should not.  The Lord's welcome to
'em, I assure you.  Time was when I wouldn't have
minded; but now I do.  Everybody knows the sort of luck
I've had of late."
</p>

<p>
"This may be good luck in disguise," returned Taverner.
</p>

<p>
"Who knows but what these infants be born to set you on
your legs again?  They may have the very cleverness of
their grandfather Churchward or their grandmother
Weekes."
</p>

<p>
In a corner Mr. Huggins and Philip Weekes sat together.
They were not discussing the twins; but it happened that
one of the huckster's fits of depression was upon him, and
he hinted at a few personal sorrows to the aged man.
Valentine's mind moved slowly, and demanded great length
of time to grasp any change.  Many months had passed
since his friend's illness, yet Mr. Huggins only now began
to appreciate the fact that he was restored to health.  He
continued to inquire as to Philip's condition.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a great blessing to know that you'm fully returned
to the use of all your parts, I'm sure.  It encourages us
old chaps to hear of such recoveries.  Do you call yourself
perfectly well again yet?"
</p>

<p>
"Well as ever I was.  'Twasn't doctor, but the missis
told me when I'd recovered.  One day, without any warning,
as I comed in from the fowls for my drop of beef tea, which
I'd got rather to rely upon, she said there wasn't none, and
she went on to add that I was 'a dare-devil old Gubbins,
and would eat us all out of hearth and home, if she'd let
me.'  So then I knowed I was cured."
</p>

<p>
"A great female, Phil."
</p>

<p>
"She is; yet here and there, to say it without any bad
meaning, I often wish she wanted more sleep.  I'm a hog
for sleep&mdash;'tis my nature to be so.  I like ten hours when
I can get it; but she&mdash;she don't cry out for more sleep than
a bird takes in summer.  I've knowed her talk till light
scores an' scores of times.  And she stops gradual, not
sudden.  She'll drop remarks, on and on and on&mdash;like a
bell tolling for death, or a cock crowing.  She don't snore,
thank God&mdash;which shows how one evil be balanced against
another, come to think of it."
</p>

<p>
"The human snore cuts to the ear-drum almost afore any
other sound," declared Mr. Huggins.  "For my part I
can go on through thunder or the elements like a new-born
child; but my wife was a great midnight trumpeter.
Cotton-wool's a good thing against it."
</p>

<p>
"What be you going to call your brace o' boys, Weekes,
Junior?" asked Mr. Pearn.  He had just returned home,
and now appeared behind his bar and renewed a subject that
was already exhausted.
</p>

<p>
"Damn my brace of boys," retorted Weekes brutally.
"I don't want to hear no more about my brace of boys for
the present.  Give me a drop of whisky."
</p>

<p>
Noah Pearn obeyed and laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Dare say you wish they was a brace of birds instead of
boys&mdash;then you could eat 'em and have done with them."
</p>

<p>
"Pearn!" said Mr. Churchward.  "I'll thank you to
be more careful.  A jest is a jest, and I believe I am
considered as quick to laugh at a piece of wholesome fun, within
the limits of propriety, as any man; but it ill becomes the
head of a family, like you, to say such a thing.  That is
not a gentlemanly joke, but simple coarseness, and you
ought to know a great deal better."
</p>

<p>
"Sorry," answered Mr. Pearn.  "I stand corrected."
</p>

<p>
"Their names are already decided upon," continued the
schoolmaster.  "Very much to my gratification one tender
bud is going to be called 'Adam'&mdash;after me, rather than
the original father of the human race; and the other will
be called 'Jarratt,' after his father.  So much is settled.
They will each bear a second Christian name, but these have
not yet been decided upon.  I may mention that I was
the only member of the family who was not astonished at
this circumstance."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" asked Jacob Taverner.
</p>

<p>
"For the simple reason that the thing has frequently
happened before in the Churchward race," answered Adam.
"I myself was one of two at a birth, though who would
think it?"
</p>

<p>
"It runs in families&mdash;like drink and other disasters,"
said Mr. Huggins.  "Did your twin die early or late,
schoolmaster?"
</p>

<p>
"Almost immediately.  In fact, my dear parents had to
have her christened before she was two days old.
Otherwise she would have passed away outside the pale of
Christianity.  I also seemed likely to perish; and they were
so hurried that they had no leisure to think out our names.
So they called us after our first parents.  Poor Eve died
soon after the sacred ceremony had been consummated.
And I was spared by the inscrutable intelligence of Heaven.
Still it was a case of <i>arcades ambo</i>, as we say."

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br><br>
THE LOAN
</h3>

<p>
Dartmoor has been chosen by Nature for a theatre of
worship and of work&mdash;a hypæthral temple, wherein she
ministers before the throne of the sun, nurtures life, ripens
her harvest, and buries her uncounted dead.  Each year
springtime breaks the bud joyfully and lifts the little lark
into the blue; each year the summer builds and the autumn
gleans; each year, when the sun's lamp is lowered, when
the curtain of cloud is drawn, sleep and death pass by
together along the winter silences.  Thus the punctual rite
and round are accomplished century after century, and, at
each year's end, arise immemorial threnodies of many waters
and fierce winds.  Rivers roar a requiem; and their inevitable
dirge is neither joyful nor mournful, but only glorious.
The singers also are mortal; the wind and the wave are
creatures, even as the perishing heath, crumbling stone, and
falling foliage; they too rise and set, triumph and expire;
they too are a part of the only miracle of the universe: the
miracle of matter made manifest in pomp and wonder, in
beauty and mystery, where Nature rolls her endless frieze
along the entablature of Time.
</p>

<p>
Beneath December sunlight Dartmoor stretched in sleep&mdash;a
sleep that lay hidden under death.  Rack and ruin of
many fair things were scattered upon the bosom of the
wilderness, and all pursued their appointed way to
dissolution.  The conventional idea of man's mind was reversed,
as usual, by this wide natural process; for death lay exposed
league upon league under the operation of air and light, frost,
and water; while life was buried and invisibly received back
its proper payment for the year's work accomplished.  But
mortality so exhibited revealed nothing unseemly or sad,
for much beauty belonged to it.  The land rose stark to
its tors, and the shattered summits of the range rolling
south-west from Great Links, towered dark against the low
slant of the winter sun.  Some fleeting mist, like a vapour
of silver, swept around the highest turrets and shone very
dazzling by contrast with the gloomy northern faces of the
hills; while far below, huddled, as it were, beneath the
reach of the horizontal light, there hung a leaden and
visible heaviness of air.  On the shoulders of the Moor
drowsed pallid sunshine, but little warmth was yielded
thereby.  Dartmoor soaked up this illumination like a sponge,
and did not waken at its tepid touch.  The wilderness slept
at noon; and in its sleep it frowned.  Over all spread the
mighty, mottled patchwork of the hour&mdash;the immeasurable,
ancient, outworn habit flung down by Nature when she
disrobed for sleep.  The summer green had vanished, the
autumn fire was cold; where heath had wakened into
amethyst, swart patches and tracts of darkness now scattered
upon the livid pelt of dead grass, like the ebony pattern on
the coat of a leopard.  But while the ling was sad-coloured
and sombre, the heather had taken a cheerful green.  Under
humid sunshine this huge design was apparent; then the
west darkened and the pale gold of the sky became blurred
by veils of rain.  They swept up slowly and cast gloom over
the light.  The Moor colours all changed beneath their
shadow and ran together.  Only within stone's-throw from
a man's eyes might detail and distinction still be marked.
There persisted the shades and half shades of the dead, grey
bloom-bells of the ling; there shone manifold minute, bright
vegetation on scattered boulders; and there the wet brake-fern,
that scattered these slopes with fallen filigree of deepest
auburn, uttered its last expression of beauty.
</p>

<p>
Caught in the heavy rain, a man who walked upon the
side of Great Links ran for the summit, and dived into a
familiar cavern, where rocks fell together and made shelter.
To his surprise the first wayfarer found a second already
taking refuge against this sudden storm; and thus met
Jarratt Weekes and Daniel Brendon on a day near Christmas.
</p>

<p>
This accident inspired the elder man.  He had long
contemplated certain propositions with regard to Daniel, and
now opportunity was thrust upon him and he prepared to
take advantage of it.
</p>

<p>
They tendered friendly welcomes, asked each for the
other's good news, and together deplored the weather.  There
had been a wet, cold summer that denied the prophecy
of spring, and many a moorman faced the approaching
season with fear.
</p>

<p>
"Rain&mdash;rain&mdash;rain&mdash;curse the rain!" said Weekes.
"Rain driving deep enough to drown the dead in their
graves."
</p>

<p>
"There's not much to be said for this autumn's work,
truly.  We must hope for a good year coming.  We shan't
have such another for certain.  Not that it matters so much
to us, since we depend on beasts."
</p>

<p>
"'Twill mean buying a lot of hay, surely?"
</p>

<p>
"Not for us.  We had a bit of luck.  I saved a fortnight
before my neighbours, and catched a spell of dry weather.
They laughed to see me cutting so early.  'Let 'em laugh,'
said Prout.  'They laugh best who laugh last.'  And so
it fell out."
</p>

<p>
"Most of the Lydford hay was ruined."
</p>

<p>
"And the corn on top.  'Twas beaten down, just too late
for it to get up again.  There'll be trouble this winter, I'm
much afeared."
</p>

<p>
"There is trouble&mdash;everywhere already.  And for my
part I haven't got to look further than my own roof to
find it."
</p>

<p>
"Very sorry to hear you say so, I'm sure.  What was
the end of that mine business?  Somebody said they was
going to try again; but that's to fling good money after
bad, I should judge."
</p>

<p>
"Damn the mine: I've done with it anyhow.  My wife
had a hundred pound from her father when she came to
me; and now 'tis gone in that swindle, along with another
hundred of my own."
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-286.jpg" alt="BENEATH GREAT LINKS.">
<br>
BENEATH GREAT LINKS.
</p>

<p>
"They'm tricky things to put money in.  I wonder you
risked it."
</p>

<p>
"There wasn't no risk on paper.  Their figures would
have convinced any man.  But they lied, and did it under
the law, so that they be safe.  I'm in a very tight place
indeed, to be frank with you.  I've got a few stiff bills to
meet this quarter, and there's only two ways of doing it
now.  One is to sell out of a little investment or two that
is paying well; and that's a cruel thing to do for a man
with a wife and an expensive family.  And t'other is to
find a friend that'll prove a real friend, and raise a bit of
money to tide over till spring."
</p>

<p>
"You ought to be able to do it."
</p>

<p>
"I can, no doubt; but I'm proud.  'Tisn't everybody
I'd go to&mdash;even for a trifle like a hundred pound.  I've got
to show security, and nobody likes opening out their private
affairs to other men.  I'd thought about it, however, for
it must be done.  And it may astonish you to hear I'd nearly
settled who I was going to."
</p>

<p>
Brendon nodded.
</p>

<p>
"You'll have no difficulty," he repeated.
</p>

<p>
"That's for you to say; for 'tis you I intended to ask."
</p>

<p>
"Me!"
</p>

<p>
"Why not?  We all know you're a snug man nowadays.
You ban't bringing Ruddyford into the front rank of
Dartymoor farms for nothing.  You're not doing all those big
things down there, and taking in land, and doubling your
sheep, and buying pedigree cattle and all the rest of it, for
nothing.  You're putting hundreds into Woodrow's pocket;
and, as a sane man, I suppose you look to it that a bit sticks
in your own."
</p>

<p>
"That's right enough, though it's the future rather than
the present I think for."
</p>

<p>
"So we all do.  It's the future that's troubling me.  I've
got a policy of life insurance to be paid next week, and it's
got to be paid.  The only question is how.  There's that
and fifty pounds for other things, besides ten I owe my
mother.  So the long and short is I want a hundred, and I
shall be a good bit obliged to you if you'll lend it to me for
six months."
</p>

<p>
Brendon did not answer immediately.  Then he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"If ten or even fifteen&mdash;I've done a little this year, to
tell you privately.  I've helped my married sister to
Plymouth, whose husband is very much under the weather, and
I've gived Joe Tapson a trifle too.  He's left us.  I had to
make a change.  Then there's the monument to Mr. Friend.
Altogether you've asked at a very awkward moment."
</p>

<p>
Jarratt sneered.
</p>

<p>
"It's always an awkward moment when a man asks a
fellow-man to do him a kindness.  And them as talk about
the decent things they do&mdash;you'll find they don't do many
as a rule.  Ban't a habit, else they'd not think 'em worth
naming."
</p>

<p>
Daniel's face hardened.
</p>

<p>
"Why d'you say that?  Can't you see I had to give you a
reason for refusing?  And don't you know me well enough
to know that I'd give the true reason or none?  'Twas out
of consideration for your feelings I said so much.  Ban't
pleasant to beg, and ban't pleasant to refuse."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not begging.  And you should not use the word.
I'm wanting to raise a loan at proper interest&mdash;four per
cent., if you like.  That's not begging.  That's offering
anybody with any sense a good investment for money."
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't want no interest at all.  I'm in your debt
to the extent of losing my temper and striking you years
ago, and I've not forgot it; and I'd be glad to do you a
service.  I've always looked out for the chance."
</p>

<p>
"You needn't mention that.  I remember very well.
There's a white mark across the bridge of my nose, Brendon,
that reminds me of what you did every time I look in the
glass, and always will."
</p>

<p>
"You'll forget it before I do.  But I can't lend you a
hundred, nor yet fifty.  I'll lend you&mdash;twenty the day after
to-morrow.  That's the very best I can offer."
</p>

<p>
"Useless.  I want a hundred."
</p>

<p>
"Then I'm sorry, but I can't find it."
</p>

<p>
Weekes reflected.  He was in a position considerably
more straitened than he had confessed to Brendon.  He had
overreached himself from cupidity, and now stood in debt to
several people, including his lawyer.  In this last quarter
Jarratt's relations were strained, and the man of business
refused to wait longer.  A natural darkness of disposition
had increased as a result of these troubles.  He had
quarrelled with his mother, with his wife, and with his
wife's father.  He had lost his self-respect somewhat, and
as that lessened he grew the riper for mischief.  Now he
became a little hot, and permitted himself to remember the
secret past.  At Brendon's refusal, events long gone by
rose up in the other's mind, and he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Better think twice.  You never know who you are
helping.  This hundred, even if it pinched you a thought
for the moment, might be a very good investment, though
you don't get interest for it."
</p>

<p>
Brendon stared at him.
</p>

<p>
"Come out," he said.  "The rain's done.  Perhaps I
shall understand a speech like that better in the open.  And
yet&mdash;how?  To my ear that sounds a bit curious.  Perhaps
you'll explain it."
</p>

<p>
"No, I shan't&mdash;though I might, I dare say.  'Tis for
you to decide.  I want to be friends."
</p>

<p>
"Why not, I should like to know?"
</p>

<p>
"No reason at all&mdash;if you'll lend me the money."
</p>

<p>
"And I tell you I can't."
</p>

<p>
"You mean that you won't."
</p>

<p>
"Take it as you please, if you're such a fool."
</p>

<p>
"No fool me&mdash;not by long chalks.  Perhaps the boot's
on the other leg.  Not that I threaten anything."
</p>

<p>
"'Threaten'!  Good God A'mighty&mdash;who be you to
threaten?  Best be off&mdash;or I'll threaten&mdash;and do more than
threaten!"
</p>

<p>
"Strange, such a trumpet of the Lord as you are, that
you never can keep your temper five minutes together with
me.  And yet I'm civil enough.  Your education's to blame,
I suppose.  Well, I only ask you if you'll lend me a hundred
pounds, and I only say you won't regret it if you do; but
may possibly regret it if you don't.  That's all."
</p>

<p>
"If I could, I wouldn't&mdash;not now.  You have said that
I shall regret it if I don't.  And I say 'Explain that, if
you want to remain my friend.'"
</p>

<p>
"I certainly shan't explain that.  Only remember that
those who think they stand, had sometimes better be careful
lest they fall.  And, as to friendship, I'm quite indifferent.
If you refuse this loan you're not my friend, of course.
Friendship is as friendship does.  This is my way.  I'll
wish you good-bye and a good investment for your savings."
</p>

<p>
"Better talk this out," said Brendon; but Jarratt
Weekes was already on his way.  He did not answer, and
did not look back.  Instead, he twirled his stick, whistled,
and assumed a cheerful and careless air as he departed.
</p>

<p>
Brendon stood still a long time, in some concern at this
unexpected incident.  He puzzled himself to know what it
might mean, retraced the course of his relations with Weekes
during the last few years, and could see no light.  It struck
him that Sarah Jane might be able to find some explanation.
Animosity clearly lurked in the man's temper; but on what
foundation it rested Daniel could not imagine.  The threat
he dismissed without thought, as a futile utterance of
disappointment.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br><br>
THE MEMORY OF MR. HUGGINS
</h3>

<p>
On a day after noon in late January the hand of winter
was upon Lydford, and the wet roads ran shining into the
village.  Utmost sobriety, with a scant splash of colour
here and there, marked the time.  The hedges were iron-grey,
yet they flamed now and again where a copper glow of
foliage still clung to some pollarded beech.  The great castle
scowled down from its blind windows, rain fell drearily; all
round about was mire and gloom and low mists, that crept
along hill and over fallow.  In the meadow-lands grass
seemed trodden into mud; the very streets repined,
and no life was revealed save where fowls sat in the
boughs of a laurel and resigned themselves to sleep and
forgetfulness, and where a lonely dog trotted along the
main thoroughfare.  In an open doorway of a carpenter's
shop two men planed coffin planks; and further on came
clink of chisel and mallet from a shed where a stonemason
was hammering at a granite cross.  The only human life
visible seemed occupied with death.  Each wayside garden
was a litter of ragged stalk and stem that cried to be hidden;
but the little golden yew, beside the home of Philip Weekes,
shone like a candle across the waning day, and rose sprightly
and cheerful in the languor and depression of the hour.
</p>

<p>
Aloft a winged people did not share Lydford's gloom.
Starlings much frequented the village at this season, and
towards nightfall assembled in many thousands together,
where certain elms stood beside the castle.  Here, in a living
stream, they flowed up from hedgerows and fields, until the
naked boughs were black with them.  They forced the sense
of their presence upon the most abstracted spirit, and raised
a merry din that was audible a mile distant.  This life
dominated dusk until one felt a sojourner in the abode of
birds rather than any home of men.  If a door slammed or
a man shouted, the myriads would simultaneously take wing
and launch like a black cloud into the air.  Then, uttering
a sound as of many waters, they whirled and warped,
gyrated, turned, and with a gradual hush of diminishing noise
regained their perches, folded their feathers, and resumed
their shouting.  Only with night did they depart into
darkness and silence.  Then, one by one, the windows twinkled
with fire, and there came a wakening moment when men
returned from their labour and the street echoed to slow,
splashing boots and human voices lifted in many moods.
Children cried to each other and hastened home from school;
women, indicated in the dark by the white oblongs of their
aprons, flitted between the cottage doors and the shops;
suddenly came barking of dogs and a pitter-patter of five hundred
little hoofs, where a flock of sheep passed through the village
to an open gate beyond.  As they went, a fan of light from
the post-office window found their fleeces and flashed upon
them during their brief transit from darkness back into
darkness again.
</p>

<p>
Behind the sheep came Joe Tapson, and beside him walked
Jarratt Weekes.  They were discussing Brendon, and the
widower talked, while the other listened to him.
</p>

<p>
"Turned me off, like a worn-out dog, for no reason on
God's earth except I was losing my nature and getting old!
May the time come when the same happens to him; may
I live to see him begging his bread&mdash;that's what I pray; and
me, now I'm up in years, brought down to do a common
drover's work and thankful for a roof to cover me."
</p>

<p>
"Wanted a younger and spryer man, I suppose," said
Jarratt indifferently.  "Don't see you've got much call to
grumble.  'Tis the curse of all men who have to trust to
their bodies for a living and not their brains, that a time
comes when they be worn out.  I heard from Sarah Jane
that Daniel was sorry to be rid of you, only he couldn't help
it in justice to the farm.  She told me Mr. Woodrow gave
you five pounds when you left."
</p>

<p>
"What's that?  'Tis nothing against the cruelty of
flinging me off.  They don't fling Prout off, though he's
far more useless than me.  They don't sack that sour-faced,
sour-minded bag of bones, Tabitha."
</p>

<p>
"They are old servants&mdash;retainers.  'Tis quite a different
matter.  Here's my way.  I hope you'll get a fixed job
soon.  But I can't help you; my luck's out too, and I'm a
long way worse off than you for the minute.  You've got
only your own carcase to think of; I've got a wife and
children."
</p>

<p>
Tapson departed behind the sheep, and Jarratt Weekes
dropped in upon his mother.  He found her out, but Sarah
Jane had also come to see Hephzibah.  She was talking to
Philip when the huckster's son arrived.
</p>

<p>
"Can't wait no more, Mr. Weekes.  Tell your wife&mdash;why,
here's Jarratt!  Where's your mother got to, Jar?"
</p>

<p>
"I want her myself," he said.  "Down there chattering
to the people at Little Lydford, I suppose, and setting the
world right in general, no doubt."
</p>

<p>
"I can't wait no longer, else Daniel will fear for me.
'Twas only about the butter.  How be you faring, and how's
Mary?  Haven't seen her this longful time."
</p>

<p>
"She thought you'd forgot her, like one or two more of
late."
</p>

<p>
"You say that.  Mary never did.  She knows me a long
sight better than that."
</p>

<p>
"I'll see you part of your road," said Jarratt.  "I want
to speak to you; and you want to speak to me."
</p>

<p>
He referred to a previous conversation.
</p>

<p>
Sarah Jane nodded, bade Mr. Weekes good-bye, and
went out with Jarratt.
</p>

<p>
"What did he say?  But I know.  You'd have let me
hear before now if the man had any wish to befriend me.
Did you ask for Mary's sake?  That was the only chance
I know."
</p>

<p>
"I did.  I said how she'd been troubled beyond reason of
late, and that the money would go far to lessen her load.  I
asked more than once for her, and he was sorry he couldn't
do it.  You know him.  He doesn't make excuses or anything
like that.  He just said that if he could have done it,
he would have, and gladly.  But it's out of his power, so
there's an end.  Won't anybody else oblige you?  Wouldn't
Mr. Churchward?"
</p>

<p>
"He can't.  He's got that great, slack, good-for-nought
William on his hands again.  How he endures the worthless
rascal beats me; but so it is.  A pity your husband don't see
his way&mdash;a very great pity indeed."
</p>

<p>
"I feel the same, I'm sure.  I wish there was anything
I could do for Mary.  Would it rest her if I was to take your
eldest boy home along with me for a bit?"
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"No, no; 'tisn't little things like that; 'tis the big thing
of having to find three figures and lose money on it.  I know
right well Brendon could do it.  And I'll tell you more than
that: he's making a mistake not to."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis out of his power, I tell you."
</p>

<p>
"I know better."
</p>

<p>
"You oughtn't to speak so."
</p>

<p>
"Oughtn't I?  Well, we all do what we oughtn't
sometimes&mdash;even you and Daniel.  Tell him this: that I want
the money badly and I make it a very special favour, and I
shall be greatly obliged to him, for all our sakes, if he'll
manage to find it for me by Ladyday next.  Tell him that.
And use what influence you've got, Sarah Jane.  You know
what I felt for you once&mdash;well, I'm fond enough of you
still&mdash;much too fond to bring any trouble on you if I can prevent
it.  So try with all your might to get Dan to see sense."
</p>

<p>
He left her no time to answer, but turned away abruptly.
She stood still a moment, then, in deep astonishment went
on her way; and presently told Daniel of the matter.
</p>

<p>
"He's desperate seemingly," said her husband.  "Even
so he talked to me, but dared not go quite so far as he did
to you.  Threats be the weapons of weak men.  He was
always fond of talking rather large.  Even so Joe Tapson
spoke when he had to go.  The good I did him was not
remembered.  He cared nothing for that.  As for Weekes,
I can't help him, and there's an end of it."
</p>

<p>
Brendon dismissed the subject from his mind and bade
Sarah Jane do the like.  He went on his way, and life with
its thousand calls soon made him forget the tribulations of
Jarratt Weekes.  His wife, however, did not overlook them,
because, when possible, she visited Mary and heard of the
increasing difficulties of her husband.
</p>

<p>
And Jarratt himself allowed embarrassment to breed
ferocity, as happens often with small-minded men.  When
he left Sarah Jane after uttering his threat, he returned to
Lydford and went to drink at the Castle Inn.  Full well
he knew that Daniel Brendon was not to be moved, and he
dared not approach him directly for fear of actual injury to
himself.  But he had reached striking point; out of his own
vexed and troubled heart rose a fierce longing to bring
vexation and trouble upon others.  He scarcely realized the
terrific gravity of any attack on Brendon at this juncture, for
the years had dulled his memory, and only one main fact
respecting Daniel's wife stuck there.  Given prosperity and
sustained success, he might never have struck; but now a
time had come when misfortune played the lodestone and
drew from him an active and avid malignity.  He smarted to
see the other rise from strength to strength.  He did not
perceive that even rumours of the truth would bring absolute
and utter ruination, or he might have hesitated.  All he
designed as yet was a drop of gall for Brendon's full cup of
sweetness.  He thought how to embitter; but he did not
desire to poison.  He failed, as many a coarse-minded soul
fails, to perceive that what for him might be no more than
affliction and transitory torment, to a greater spirit must mean
everlasting wreck and perdition.
</p>

<p>
With a mind quite empty he entered the inn, ordered his
drink and waited to catch the thread of the conversation before
taking his part in it.  Taverner was there, and old Huggins.
The latter talked, and half-a dozen men in the bar listened
to him.  Noah Pearn served his customer with liquor and
explained the subject.
</p>

<p>
"Valentine here be running on the past to-day, and he's
gone back fifty years in his memory as easy as we go back
a month.  He often will after a third glass.  'Tis a pity
there's none to write down the things he calls home; for
they'll all perish with him, and some of 'em be very well
worth remembering."
</p>

<p>
He stopped, and they listened to the ancient.
</p>

<p>
"Them days of barley bread!  But which among you
folk ever tasted it?  Harsh it was and made us far shorter
and sharper than we be nowadays.  I've seed a chap buried
at cross-roads with a stake drove through his carcase.  'Twas
thought he'd killed hisself, and cross-roads was the grave
of such people then.  By night they buried him; and by
night they dug him up again."
</p>

<p>
"Dug him up, Val!" cried Mr. Pearn.  "Surely not.
What for did they dig him up again?"
</p>

<p>
"Because a year later 'twas found that he'd died by
lawful murder and never took his life at all!  A valiant
man, as stopped coaches on the Launceston Road, was
catched red-handed, and tried to Exeter, and hanged 'pon
Gibbet Hill above Mary Tavy.  The last hanging there
'twas&mdash;somewhere about the year 1790, I reckon, or may have
been later.  But I went to see the sight, as a small boy,
and afore they turned the bold feller off, he confessed that
among other wicked things, he'd put a bullet through the
chap we buried, because the chap had seed him stop a
coach and marked him.  And he'd left a old hoss-pistol by
the chap a purpose to make it look as if he'd done it hisself.
So they dug him up again and gived his fragments a proper
box, and laid him in holy ground, and parson made a
whole-hearted speech about it, and forgived everybody, as he hoped
to be forgiven."
</p>

<p>
"The things you've seen!" murmured a young man.
</p>

<p>
"True for you&mdash;few living have seen the like.  Ripe old
customs, as be gone past recalling.  And religion at the
back of all we did and thought in them days.  Even wassailing
the apple-trees be dying out, and charms, and all them
high ways we had of reproving lightness and sin, and
punishing evil-doers afore the nation.  I never seed a human
creature whipped at the cart-tail myself, and I'm glad I
didn't, for that's a very horrid idea, though 'twas often
well enough deserved; but other things I have seen, when
the evil-doer has been catched out in his sins and held up
in the sight of all men.  'Twas a sign, no doubt, that men
were rising in knowledge and understanding when we
punished their minds instead of their backs, and made them
a sign and a byword without putting a hand upon 'em."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Huggins paused, quite weary.  He had been talking
a long time, and before Weekes arrived he had sung an old
song to an old tune.
</p>

<p>
"Wonnerful form he's in," whispered Taverner.  "I
hope it ban't the last flicker of the candle, and we shall
hear presently the cold have took him off.  He'd be quite a
loss in company."
</p>

<p>
Weekes nodded.  Certain words let drop by the venerable
chronicler had fallen upon the hungry soil of his mind and
taken root there.  Now he desired further speech with
Valentine, and presently offered him an arm upon his way.
</p>

<p>
"I must get you to sing that song to me," he said.
"You'm a wonderful old man, Val.  To think that you
can sing and mind a tune and the words and everything,
and you up eighty-three or more."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis so.  Not a note out of place, I believe, though the
high ones roll up into my head and miscarry somewhat.
Still there 'tis: I've got it; and a many others I've got as
was thought pretty singing in my young manhood, but
wouldn't be vitty now.  The times be altered, and if I
singed a thing or two I know right well, you'd think I was a
very coarse-minded old chap.  Ideas have changed."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but human nature hasn't.  Did you punish frail
folk then?  There was skimmitty riding, wasn't there?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly there was; and a thing oftener done, because
dreadfuller and more solemn-like, was burying.  'Twas a
very heart-shaking affair, and the manner of it was this.
Suppose a man and woman did wrong, owing to the power
of nature upon them, or the husband being away from home,
or some other natural cause, then, if 'twas found out against
'em, the people rose up and acted a funeral.  Everything
was done decently and in order.  But you had to do it on
private land, else 'twas an unlawful assembling, like a
prize-fight or a cock-fight, and might get you into trouble.  When
the land was chosen, skilled hands made two puppets as
much like the parties as their craft could; and they was
dressed in grave-clothes, or else common clothes, and put
in coffins.  Then some man who was up to it, read the
service, and the dolls were nailed home into their boxes, and
buried underground with all the dignity of real dead people.
The service was read, and if a chap had a clever tongue,
he'd preach a bit and lash the erring victims all he could.
I've knowed cases when a man faced it out and laughed at
his own burying, and stood beer to the mourners; and I've
known cases when the parties was saved by it, and turned
to the Almighty, and was forgiven by all men; and I've
known cases where the burial was a mistake and the man
and woman were both quite innocent.  A choir and undertaker
and all, mind you.  And, besides such things as that,
I've seen witches ducked, and scolds bridled&mdash;in fact,
'twould puzzle me to tell you what I haven't seen in my
time."
</p>

<p>
Jarratt, however, kept him to the former matter, and won
various other details of the old ceremony before he bade
Valentine farewell.  His mind was stored with a fantastic
medley of ideas and possibilities when he returned to his
home; and on the following evening he re-visited Mr. Huggins
and learnt more concerning the subject that now so largely
interested him.

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br><br>
FAREWELL
</h3>

<p>
At the turn of winter John Prout went down to Dawlish,
and did not come back.  He sent a gloomy letter to Brendon,
and explained that their master desired him to remain.
</p>

<p>
"He's come down to a shadow of himself," wrote John,
"and the doctor told me yesterday, when I asked him how
things were going with Mr. Hilary, that he'd taken a bad
turn of late, and might not weather another year.  He
coughs something cruel; but he's wonderful cheerful since
he comed to believe the old things.  A clergyman often sits
along with him by the hour and does him good seemingly.
I be a large comfort to him, I do think, so I can't leave
him no more, unless he takes a turn for the good.  He wants
to see you all again, and if he doesn't come back, you and
Sarah Jane and Tabitha will have to come and see him,
for he's set upon that.  Never a man faced death braver.
Now he thinks like he does, he'll be glad to go, I do believe.
But he hasn't lost touch of Ruddyford, as you'll see by the
rest of my letter."
</p>

<p>
There followed a string of directions from Woodrow to
Brendon.  Some Daniel approved, some he disapproved; but
all were very carefully executed.  He read Prout's letter
to the farm, and wide sorrow and concern greeted it.  The
women mourned and openly wept together; Daniel went
for days silent and abstracted.  He spoke to none but his
wife.  Then Agg and Peter Lethbridge, reduced to considerable
doubt concerning their own future, ventured to question
Brendon.  They explained their uncertainties and he set
them at rest.
</p>

<p>
"What will happen when Mr. Woodrow goes is already
determined," he said.  "I can't tell you what it is till the
time comes; but this I'll say: I can promise you both to
bide here on your present money as long as you please me."
</p>

<p>
At Dawlish, Prout waited upon his fading master, nursed
him like a woman, and added to his comfort in every way
possible.  To please John, Woodrow sent for a consulting
physician from Exeter; but the man could give no hope.
</p>

<p>
Now Hilary had ceased to ride, though he let Prout drive
him when the days were fair.  Together they went in a
little pony-carriage round about the fir-fledged hills of
Haldon; and it was given to Hilary once more to see the
first glory of spring larches, once more to look into the eyes
of the violet and note the little sorrel shake forth her fleeting
loveliness.  Great peace of mind had now descended upon
him, and with reduced activities an interest in the lesser
things of nature awakened, and he loved to pluck the flowers,
as a child plucks them, yet with the understanding of a
man.  The smell of the spring earth was good to him.  He
feared not at all to sink therein and return to Nature the
dust that she had lent him.  In his heart there reigned sure
consciousness that this was not the end; that a higher, fuller
life opened beyond the earthly portals; that the prelude
and not the play was done when the clod fell and a man's
coffin-lid vanished for ever.
</p>

<p>
To Prout he imparted these opinions, and John, who
doubted not of eternity, rejoiced to see the strength and
peace that henceforth marked his master's mind.
</p>

<p>
"How you could bear with me, John!  Often, looking
back, I marvel at the patience of you and of Brendon.
You had all that I lacked; yet you listened to my trash and
never did you rise and denounce me for a fool!"
</p>

<p>
"Not likely.  Whatever you was, you wasn't that."
</p>

<p>
"I did things then, and thought them not wrong that I
know now were wicked."
</p>

<p>
"Thank God for it that you know, master."
</p>

<p>
"But is it too late, John?"
</p>

<p>
"Never too late.  Never too late."
</p>

<p>
"I must leave mercy to my wronged Maker.  'Tis well
to be a free-thinker in a way&mdash;just as 'tis well for a country
bred man to go to cities.  You don't know what the country
really means till you've been mewed up in the town; and
you don't know what faith means till you've tried to live
without it.  So I feel.  No freedom of thought will think
right into wrong, John Prout."
</p>

<p>
"God's above all."
</p>

<p>
"Once I thought, with a wise man who lived before Christ
came, that what we men call life is only a poor shadow
dragging a corpse, like a prisoner drags his chain.  Now I
know better.  Now the things that seemed good suffer an
eclipse, and the things that seemed beautiful stand out in
their naked, ugly truth.  They were all a mirage&mdash;all
shadows in a desert of sand.  I thought that they quenched
thirst and satisfied hunger.  That was part of the great
blindness, John.  Now I know that the sun-dance and
glare and dazzle was all a wicked sham.  I wove them for
myself; I blinded myself; I deluded myself.  If I could
tell you how base I'd been&mdash;what things I did, believing
them to be reasonable and not wrong.  The folly&mdash;the
madness!  I said to myself, 'Nature does neither right nor
wrong; it is only the foolish man who calls her cruel or
kind.  She rises above these human ideas.  And so will
I.'  Yes, I thought to copy Nature and follow the thing she
prompted.  I dinned into my own ears that what I did was
far above right or wrong.  I said to myself, 'Let the fools
who like words call their actions "good" or "evil."  Do
you, for your part, look to it that your actions are
"reasonable," and so content your conscience that demands only
reason.'  What a light has burned in on all that preposterous
nonsense since!  Crimes&mdash;crimes I have committed in
the name of nature and reason.  O God, Prout, when I
think&mdash;&mdash;  And now I know that it will take a forgiving
Saviour to save me.  Well may Christ have taught us that
God is a merciful God!  I should go mad if I did not grasp
that unutterable truth, John.  To His mercy I trust
myself&mdash;and not only myself."
</p>

<p>
He prattled on of the dogmas he had now accepted, and
behind every thought and pious hope John Prout saw
Sarah Jane.  Often the sick man spoke directly of her;
more often, when declaring his new convictions he used no
names; but Prout&mdash;from his inner knowledge&mdash;perceived
which way his master's mind was tending.  He gathered
that Hilary hoped Sarah Jane would presently come to see
with her husband's eyes and abandon a certain large
enthusiasm for her own kind in favour of a narrower trust and
confidence in the tenets of Christianity alone.  Once or
twice Prout believed that the other was actually going to
confess his action of the past; but Hilary never did so.
He told his old servant that the farm had been left to
Brendon, but he gave no reason for the step.  He was,
however, quick enough to be astonished at John's lack of
surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Did he tell you?  Did you know it, that you take it
so calmly?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"To be frank, I did know it," answered John.  "Don't
blame her.  You understand women better'n me; and you'll
guess how hard 'twas for her to keep it in.  'Twas a night
five year ago and more, when chance throwed us together
at Lydford, and she helped me home against a storm.  By
the same token a rainbow showed over against the moon.
Of course I never spoke of it again; more did she."
</p>

<p>
"You don't blame me?"
</p>

<p>
"Who be I to blame you?  No man on earth have ever
had a better master than what you have been to me."
</p>

<p>
"And no man ever loved a man better than you have
loved me, John.  Well I know it."
</p>

<p>
So oftentimes they talked, and when Hilary was unequal
to speech he made Prout read to him and rehearse those
things that he best liked to hear repeated.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, however, the sick man cared for no company
other than his thoughts; and then he would bid John
depart, and for hours together brood upon the past and
survey his vanished deeds in the light of present belief.  A
fading memory served to dim their details, and what was
left faith much distorted.  He remembered the glow and
glory of the first kiss, and loathed that damnable contact
as the beginning of the master-sin of his days; he beheld
himself imparadised in those lovely arms; and he shuddered
and saw all hell watching with hungry eyes.
</p>

<p>
Woodrow knew that he would not return to Ruddyford.
He had planned to die there; but now he was indifferent,
and already pictured his own mound under the shadow of
the old church at Dawlish.  He was desirous, however, to
take leave of his few friends, and invited Prout to plan
their visits in such a way that they should not know these
meetings must be the last.
</p>

<p>
Miss Prout first came and spent three days.  With her
she brought little dishes made with her own hands; and
while she remained at Dawlish she spent most of her time
in the kitchen, to the concern of the landlady, who resented
Tabitha.  Hilary cared not much for Prout's sister, and
bade her good-bye indifferently.  She returned home with
a black story of his decline, and foretold that he must soon
pass.  Next Daniel went down, but the time was full of
work, and he stayed a very short while.  To speak became
increasingly difficult for Woodrow; yet he liked to listen
to Daniel, and came to him in some respects as a learner.
He invited Brendon to preach to him, and the earnestness
and conviction of the big man impressed him.  Old
instincts awoke to the challenge at these dogmatic utterances,
but the sufferer smothered them.  He believed them no
more than a mere mechanical process of the brain&mdash;a reflex
action persisting after the death of the habit of thought
that was responsible for it.  He made himself believe all
that Brendon did.  And, last of all, he believed in hell,
because Christ did.
</p>

<p>
Hilary was frank with Daniel, and did not hide his
approaching end.
</p>

<p>
"I shall hope to see you once more," he said.  "And
that will be the last time.  I should much wish you to be
with me when I die, if that is not a selfish wish.  Would
you mind?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  I want to be with you then.  Do you like the
minister here?  Is he the right man for you?"
</p>

<p>
"I value him very much.  A gentle, hopeful man."
</p>

<p>
"Be sure I'll come."
</p>

<p>
"And I must see Sarah Jane too.  Don't tell her that
it will be the last time, because that would be a great grief
to her, for she's fond of me, I know."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she is."
</p>

<p>
"Let her come next week for a day or two, if you
can spare her.  But I'll not tell her that it's the last
'good-bye.'  All the same, I'm afraid she'll guess it for
herself."
</p>

<p>
"Try to do her good&mdash;same as you have me," said
Brendon.  "You won't speak many more words on human
ears now.  Let 'em be as the Lord wills.  He'll put it
into your heart what to say to her.  A better, nobler
woman than my wife never lived.  Fearless and brave and
high-minded&mdash;I never saw the like of her and never shall.
But all the same, from the first&mdash;from our courting&mdash;there
was always something I couldn't understand.  Her point of
view&mdash;not all pure godliness; yet I'd not dare to say she
was ungodly in anything.  But a sort of high habit of mind
that wouldn't bend to the yoke.  Always hated and still
hates to call herself a miserable sinner afore the footstool
of Grace.  Yet humble, and gentle, and true to my heart
and my hopes here and hereafter, as the moss is true to
the stone."
</p>

<p>
"No man was ever worthy of her, Daniel."
</p>

<p>
"I know it.  Tell her the meek are blessed and inherit
the earth."
</p>

<p>
"And blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see
God.  I've never known but one woman that I could think
of as able to look at God, Daniel, and that's your wife.
Don't ask me to dare to teach her&mdash;'tis for her to teach
me; and teach you too.  Why should she be fearful?  She
can't be.  Perfect love casteth out fear.  That's her lesson
to us."
</p>

<p>
Brendon considered doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"You may be right," he said.  "All the same&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And when the future owner of Ruddyford returned home,
his wife made ready.  She knew full well without words
that this was her last visit to Hilary Woodrow; and she
braced her mind for the ordeal and all that it must mean.
She had long since ceased to fear that he would speak, and
when Sarah Jane and Hilary met for the last time it was not
necessary for him to inform her that their secret perished
with themselves.
</p>

<p>
"Leave it to be told in the next world, if it is right that
it should be told," he said to her.  "Sometimes I think
it may be a part of my purgation and proper punishment,
in some place of learning and cleansing, that I may yet have
to confess this terrible sin before my fellow spirits&mdash;even
to the spirit of Daniel himself, when his turn comes.  That
seems justice, Sarah Jane, as man pictures justice in his
feeble ignorance.  But at any rate I'm convinced, so far as
this life goes, that the proper course is silence.  We've no
right to wreck lives by imparting our knowledge to them,
if that knowledge can only bring ceaseless suffering along
with it.  I've confessed my sin to God a thousand times.
But I know that both punishment and absolution belong to
the world to come, not to this."
</p>

<p>
"Like a schoolboy called up afore his master&mdash;to learn
the best or worst," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Even like that.  Nothing's settled down here; nothing
is finished down here.  Everything has to wait till the light
touches it."
</p>

<p>
"And even good and evil ban't understood down here.
Maybe you'll find in that light you won't cut such a poor
figure after all.  Ban't your many great, good, generous
deeds and kindly thoughts to count?  Ban't your last years
to count?  Be it a small thing that you've fought your way
to your God through all that thicket of books?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a small thing for myself, certainly.  All the
difference between heaven and hell, Sarah Jane."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't let that last word come on your lips, for
God's sake," she begged.  "I do hate it, like I hate a
snake.  Sometimes, for all I'm so glad that you are happy
and have got God, I can find it in me to wish you was the
same as you used to be without Him.  You was a deal
braver, when you laughed at hell, than you be now.  And
I'll laugh at hell for ever and ever&mdash;laugh at it still, even
if I was to find myself in it."
</p>

<p>
"Think of me as I am, Sarah Jane, and believe what I
say now.  Don't remember me as I was, or call back the
vile things I uttered then.  Do you remember that once I
said God was only the shadow of man's self reflected against
the background of his own self-consciousness?  I thought
that a very fine idea when I made it up.  Now I know 'twas
the Devil that prompted it."
</p>

<p>
"I reckoned nobody believed in God and hell both&mdash;except
my own dear Daniel.  And now he's got you to think the
same.  But I hoped 'twould be t'other way round, and you'd
make him flout it."
</p>

<p>
"Christ believed in it."
</p>

<p>
"An' quenched it for ever, didn't He?  So some seem
to think, anyhow.  Mr. Matherson be shaky about it, I'm
sure, for Dan's very unsettled with the Luke Gospellers
along of that very thing.  He's going to leave 'em.  'Tis
a great grief to him to go, but he says that Mr. Matherson's
in danger, and that much larning have made him mad here
and there.  Did you ever hear tell of the Salvation Army?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  It's a new thing, but it's growing fast, and my
clergyman believes that in time to come it may be a great
power for good in the world."
</p>

<p>
"Dan's very much took by it; but Mr. Matherson be
doubtful.  My husband's like to join 'em, I believe.  He
says they work on Bible bed-rock, and seem to him to
follow closer on the actual words of the Lord than any of
the regulars."
</p>

<p>
"If 'tis a good thing, God will surely bless it, Sarah
Jane."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis all one to me, so long as Daniel is content."
</p>

<p>
They made pretence that this was not the last meeting,
and that Sarah Jane should come down again in the summer
and bring her child.  But death was written on the man's
face now, and she knew how soon the end must come.
The religious atmosphere, with which he surrounded himself,
stifled her worse than the physical odours of a sick
chamber.  When the clergyman came, she was glad to rush
away for a time and walk by the sea.
</p>

<p>
Hilary rarely rose before noon; but on the day that she
was to return home he partially dressed and went into a
sitting-room.  It faced south, and the train, which was to
take her away, would pass along in sight of it.
</p>

<p>
Their actual parting was brief.  Prout left them alone
and waited outside.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;the best and bravest of living
things that I have ever seen," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, dear Hilary.  We shall meet again&mdash;somewhere."
</p>

<p>
"I know it&mdash;thank my God I know it."
</p>

<p>
She went close to him and looked into his haggard face.
Then she kissed him.
</p>

<p>
"I'll wave my handkercher as the train passes."
</p>

<p>
"And I'll wave mine, Sarah Jane."
</p>

<p>
Presently, when the train steamed along between Hilary
Woodrow and the sea, though Prout waved from the window
and Woodrow stood behind him and strained to catch his
last glimpse of her, they only marked her hand held out,
and the dance of her handkerchief fluttering.  She saw
nothing, for the blue of her April eyes was dimmed and
drowned.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br><br>
THE DOLLS
</h3>

<p>
"Jar," said Mrs. Weekes, "you be getting on home to
fifty years old, and since I first slapped your breech, when
you'd been in the world a matter of six months, you and
me have never had no grave difference of opinion."
</p>

<p>
"What then?" asked the man.
</p>

<p>
Sarah Jane was spending a soft May evening at the
cottage of Mary; but, not desiring to be in her presence,
Jarratt left them and went to see his mother.  For some
time Hephzibah had expressed a desire for private conversation
with him, and now Jarratt gave her the opportunity.
But quickly he regretted it.  Rumour had reached his
mother's ears, and she felt very agitated to learn that some
strange and most unusual event was pending.  Only whispers
and hints had reached her, and since such shadowy insinuations
were specially offensive to her mind, she commanded
her son before her and ordered him to be plain.
</p>

<p>
"What then?" repeated Jarratt.
</p>

<p>
"Then 'twould be an everlasting shame and misfortune
if we fell out now&mdash;you in your prime and me with my
white hair and coming to the end of my days.  You've
never hid much from me that I know of, and nothing that
I didn't find out if I wanted to.  So don't try now.  There's
all manner of beastly whisperings in the air; and you be in
them.  Wherever I go to have a talk, people say, 'What's
this here thing Mr. Jarratt be up to?'  And when I tell 'em
I don't know, they shut their mouths and change the
subject."
</p>

<p>
"So much the better.  It don't concern you, anyway."
</p>

<p>
"You can say that!  But it do concern me, and I will
know the truth of it.  From all I hear it concerns everybody
called Weekes; for the credit of a family be of some account,
though 'tis only a family of dormice, like your father's
family.  I was born a Mudge; and that's a lasting blessing
to me; and you've got my blood in you and ban't going to
demean it, I should hope."
</p>

<p>
"If old Huggins have been talking&mdash;or William Churchward
either, I'll wring their necks!"
</p>

<p>
"Jar," answered his mother.  "'Tis an old saying, and
true as old, that Satan finds mischief for idle hands.  Hard
luck you've had of late, and to my cost I know it; but
because you've been forced to wait and use patience, and
haven't had the usual chances to be busy, that ban't no
reason why for you should use your time ill.  Guy Fawkes
and angels!  Isn't the world full of chances to do right?
Better bide home and nurse the babbies than go out to do
other folks a wrong turn."
</p>

<p>
"When I'm hit, I hit back."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know nothing about the parties, and don't want
to know.  If a man's hurt you, hit him back from the
shoulder so hard as you know how.  But this&mdash;this thing
I hear.  Even if 'tis true, and some poor unhappy girl have
made a slip&mdash;good God Almighty!&mdash;you ban't a coward to
lift your hand to a woman, be you?"
</p>

<p>
"What d'you know, and what don't you know?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know no names, and 'twasn't Val, nor yet
Adam Churchward's son who told me that you'd got a plot
afoot.  Philip Weekes it was who heard it&mdash;your own
father; and very properly he put the thing afore me.
There's a middle-aged spinster down to Little Lydford, that
Bill Churchward be rather silly after, and she've screwed
a bit of news out of him seemingly.  She's one of them
nasty 'have you heard?' sort of women, always with a bit
of news on her lips&mdash;generally untrue.  And she told your
father that you and another here and there was caballing
and hatching up a cruel joke at the expense of a certain
man and woman very well known round these parts.  I
hope 'tis a lie, and I hope you'll tell me 'tis.  Then I'll go
early to market next Friday and stop at that female's house,
and say a thing or two as'll be worse than a mustard
poultice to her mean heart."
</p>

<p>
"Better mind your own business.  There's a bit of fun
in the air&mdash;that's all.  Sometimes a nod's as good as a
wink to a blind hoss.  There's a few self-righteous, damned
fools about that won't be any the worse for hearing a thing
or two they don't know."
</p>

<p>
"I don't like to hear you tell that way, and I wish to
God you was busier about your own affairs; then you
wouldn't be stirring on other people's.  Are you the man to
set this wrong right?  Ax yourself that afore you go farther."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I am."
</p>

<p>
"For my sake, Jar, think better of it."
</p>

<p>
"Too late now."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me about it, then."
</p>

<p>
"You'll know soon enough.  'Tis only a joke, when all's
said.  We are going to let the rough truth loose for once,
and tell a psalm-smiting fool a thing or two he don't know
seemingly.  Or, if he do know and have winked at it, for
his own ends, then so much the more shame to him.
Anyway, he shan't think Lydford be in the dark&mdash;not after
next Monday night."
</p>

<p>
"You won't tell me what's doing?"
</p>

<p>
"Go to that field called 'Thornyside,' what miller Taverner
owns up above the gorge, presently after nightfall, if
you want to know any more.  I'll let you hear when the day
is fixed.  'Tis only following out an ancient custom.  You
like the old ways and you like buryings, so the business will
just suit you."
</p>

<p>
"One of them mock funerals!"
</p>

<p>
"Just so."
</p>

<p>
"Then you're going to show up a bit of secret sin as
you've found out&mdash;is that it?"
</p>

<p>
"If it is?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Weekes was much concerned.
</p>

<p>
"For my son to meddle in such work as that!" she gasped.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis fun, I tell you.  Damn it all, be I to live my dreary
days without never a joke or a laugh to make life better
worth?  If you knowed a half or a quarter of the dull dog's
life I lead now and the hardships I've had of late, you'd
be only too glad for me to amuse myself sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"Don't think to fool me," she said.  "You ban't the
sort of man&mdash;no better than a savage monkey&mdash;who'd do a
thing like this for fun.  You've got your reasons.  You be
going to strike an enemy."
</p>

<p>
"Leave it at that, then, since you're so clever."
</p>

<p>
"Will he leave it at that?  I should judge what you be
wanting just now are friends, Jar, not enemies.  You are
going to hurt a man in a terrible tender place.  And if you
can't make good this charge&mdash;what then?"
</p>

<p>
"I've thought of that.  I'm not attacking any man; I'm
punishing a man for attacking me.  I want money.  I go
to a chap who is rolling in it.  I beg for a trifling loan, and
he refuses, for no reason but unkindness and want of charity.
'Tis he has made me his enemy.  And now I'll show him
up.  He's either a blind fool, or else a knave&mdash;and the
world shall know it one way or t'other."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Weekes partly read the remark.
</p>

<p>
"He's a husband, then, and you be going to let folk
know he's&mdash;what? wronged or wronging?"
</p>

<p>
"Go to Jacob Taverner's field and find out," he answered.
"I'll say no more at all upon the subject.  'Twill
all be done very decently and in order, I promise you.
There be those about who remember the same thing often
in the past."
</p>

<p>
"And so do I," said Hephzibah, "and also what comed
of one of those May games.  A man had another man's life
for it after the funeral was over, and the murderer swung
in Exeter gaol, though recommended to mercy.  You mind
what you're doing&mdash;else your childer may be orphans and
your wife a widow afore hay harvest."
</p>

<p>
Philip Weekes appeared at this moment, and Jarratt took
himself off.  He did not go home, but visited the field of
Jacob Taverner already mentioned.  It lay upon the southern
side of Lyd, and Weekes crossed the river by the bridge
over the gorge, then entered the croft, climbed its steep side,
and knocked at the door of a cowshed which stood in one
corner.  It was locked from inside, and light and the sound
of voices issued from the chinks of the wooden building.
</p>

<p>
"Who be that?" cried somebody.
</p>

<p>
"Me&mdash;Weekes," answered Jarratt.
</p>

<p>
The door opened, and he entered, to find three men.  One
was busy about a strange task; the other two sat on empty
cider-barrels and watched him.
</p>

<p>
"It's getting out," said Weekes.  "One of you fools&mdash;or
else some of the singing boys&mdash;have been chattering.
'Tis you, I believe, William, for my father heard it down
to Little Lydford from that old maid you'm so fond of."
</p>

<p>
William Churchward looked up from his work on the
ground.  He dropped a bundle of long straw and assured
Weekes that he must be mistaken.
</p>

<p>
"I only just said, in a vague way, that one of them
famous funerals of the living was on hand, and advised
her to be up at Taverner's field on a night I'd let her
know."
</p>

<p>
Jacob Taverner, another of the company, also spoke.
</p>

<p>
"All the same, we must let the people hear about it.
We want all Lydford there on the night, else the fun's
spoiled.  The more the merrier, surely.  It must be blazed
abroad."
</p>

<p>
"In reason.  But there's some won't hold with it, and
will try to stop it at the last moment."
</p>

<p>
"They can't," declared old Huggins.  "Take care of
your pipe, Jacob, or else you'll set William's straw alight
and spoil all.  They can't stop you, Jarratt, because you'll
be 'pon private land.  'Tis Jacob's field, and nobody in
the kingdom&mdash;not the Queen of England's self&mdash;have the
power to say what Jacob shall not do on his own ground.
The constable may be allowed in to keep the peace, and
that's all."
</p>

<p>
"When will you have the dolls done, William?" asked
Mr. Taverner.
</p>

<p>
Young Churchward desisted from his labour, rose to his
feet, and with an artist's eye regarded two headless dummies
upon which he was engaged.  They were of full human
proportions and represented a male and female.  The man's
image showed a long and thin figure.  It wore brown leggings,
riding breeches, and a Norfolk jacket.  Spurs were attached
to its boots, and from its hand, modelled in putty and
painted, there hung a hunting-stock.
</p>

<p>
"What fashioned tie did the man use to wear?" inquired
William.
</p>

<p>
"Red as often as not," answered Weekes.
</p>

<p>
"I've nearly done him.  The legs loll out too much yet,
but when young Prowse have knocked up the coffin, we'll
fit him in all natural as life."
</p>

<p>
Then he pointed to the other puppet.
</p>

<p>
"That's the very daps of <i>her</i> round shape," whispered
'the Infant' aside to Weekes, and Jarratt nodded.
</p>

<p>
"It is," he admitted.
</p>

<p>
Then he remembered what his mother had said and
turned away with a qualm.  Anon he fortified his spirit and
sneered at himself.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a good joke, sure enough.  Won't hurt nobody
really.  But 'twill make a certain psalm-singing fool of a
husband come down a peg or two.  And well the man
deserves it."
</p>

<p>
For his own comfort Weekes made this remark.
</p>

<p>
"How if the man breaks your head?" asked Taverner.
</p>

<p>
"Two can play at that game."
</p>

<p>
"When be us to know the parties?" piped Mr. Huggins.
"I'm all on fire to hear who 'tis."
</p>

<p>
"You leave that to me," answered William.  "When
you see their heads stuck on, you'll know who they be well
enough.  I've had to take Jarratt's word for the man; but
the woman everybody in Lydford will swear to, or I'm no
painter."
</p>

<p>
"Be the putty dried out, 'Infant'?" asked Weekes.
</p>

<p>
"Very nearly.  I've got the paints mixed and a fine lot
of corded rope the very colour of&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Stop!  That'll tell 'em!" cautioned the elder.
</p>

<p>
Then William rose and whispered to the senior conspirator.
</p>

<p>
"And the very thing for the eyes&mdash;a piece of luck.  I
was wandering along thinking of 'em, when what should I
see in a rubbish heap but a broken plate&mdash;blue as the sky!
I've chipped a pair of eyeballs and put the pupils in."
</p>

<p>
He showed enthusiasm for his unlovely task, and Weekes
encouraged him.
</p>

<p>
Then Churchward returned to his dummy and filled the
nether garments of the male figure with straw.
</p>

<p>
"Mustn't have too much," he said, "for by all accounts
he's a thin man&mdash;a mere skeleton of a man."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Huggins rose.
</p>

<p>
"I be going, souls," he said.  "These here lifeless
carpses be getting to make me go goose-flesh along the spine.
That true to life&mdash;that cruel true they be&mdash;that I shall dream
bad dreams about 'em if I sit here gloating any more.  They
be a masterpiece of horror and dreadfuller without their heads
than with 'em.  I'll ax you to see me up the hill, Jacob, for
'tis a very difficult task for me to breast it alone at my age."
</p>

<p>
"So I will, then," answered Taverner.  "And we'll drop
into Noah Pearn's at the top."
</p>

<p>
"Spirits 'twill be for me, if anything," said Valentine.
"I'm a bit down-daunted along of this gashly spectacle,
and I'm almost sorry now I called upon my memory to
help.  'Twill vex somebody for certain, and at my great
age us ought to rise above politics.  'Tis a terrible gift of
likeness-making the 'Infant' have got; but for my part
I'd sooner be a common man, wi'out any such devilish
cleverness."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you fear," said William.  "Nobody will pull
your old nose."
</p>

<p>
The painter, quite oblivious of the grave issues behind
this outrage, pursued his operations in a light and cheerful
spirit.  Once taken in hand, he became exceedingly interested
in his bizarre task; and now he had grown enthusiastic.
He regarded the dolls as an advertisement of neglected
talents, and he was only sorry that so much careful work
must presently be buried in the earth.  But he hoped it
might be possible to dig his masterpieces up again.
</p>

<p>
At home, under lock and key, he had fashioned two heads
of putty.  One, albeit still unpainted, indubitably resembled
Sarah Jane; the other&mdash;a shrunken visage, with eyes made
of grey slate and high cheek-bones, represented the farmer,
Hilary Woodrow.  A mass of bright tow hair fell about the
female face; the male puppet wore a round hat.  Presently
William intended to paint these effigies up to the colour of
life.  Sarah Jane he had secretly studied when she came to
visit his sister.  Her pure, bright skin, just beginning to
take the kiss of the sun as he warmed the spring again,
he already knew.  As for the male doll, putty-colour came
almost near enough to the cadaverous deterioration of the
original.
</p>

<p>
"How long will it be afore all's ready?" asked Jarratt.
</p>

<p>
"A matter of three days.  I'll bring the heads up in a
basket an hour before the show.  Taverner's going to look
after the torches, and Dicky Prowse fetches up the coffins
after dark Sunday."
</p>

<p>
"I'm only thinking of the man.  Monday's the best day
for him.  He goes into Tavistock often of a Monday, and
comes home by Lydford way.  The point is to hit on a night
when he'll be passing by here just at the proper moment.
We must made dead sure of him.  If he don't actually come
face to face with the funeral, half the fun's out of it."
</p>

<p>
William Churchward assented to this opinion.
</p>

<p>
"I'd dearly like to coax her here also; but perhaps that
would be a thought too rough," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we can't do that.  I'm not desirous to hurt her
at all.  'Tis him I'm aiming at&mdash;just to let the gas out of
him a bit and larn him that he ain't under the special care
and charge of Providence, but have to share the rough edge
of things along with his betters."
</p>

<p>
William nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Of course you've got proof positive," he said.
</p>

<p>
"I have&mdash;my own eyes and another pair.  Besides that
I've got her, come to think of it.  You know her fashion.
'Tis true, I reckon, that she never told it; but when 'tis
blowed, she won't deny it, whatever the farmer might be
tempted to do.  Anyway, he's at death's door, so we shan't
hurt him."
</p>

<p>
"If 'twas a thing of yesterday, I should be rather
frightened of the job," confessed William.  "But seeing
the matter's five years old and more&mdash;what's the odds to
any sensible person?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite right.  If they let it hurt 'em&mdash;more fools them.
Anyway, the man's no friend to me, or anybody else, for
all his cant.  He's brought this on himself."
</p>

<p>
"There&mdash;that's about all I can do for this pair of legs,"
said William.  "Now we'll lock up and be gone.  Come
and see 'Sarah Jane.'  You'll want to kiss her when I've
painted her!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br><br>
THE MOCK BURIAL
</h3>

<p>
For various reasons the event of the mock burial was
postponed until a night in late June; and then, through the
dewy twilight of evening, numerous persons proceeded from
Lydford and outlying hamlets to the field known as Thornyside
above the river.  Many motives took the company, but
not one amongst them knew the facts.  Certain folk felt
interested in the revival of an ancient use; others were only
concerned with the excitement of a new thing; and most
attended from morbid desire to know what man and woman
were to suffer this public denunciation and rebuke.
</p>

<p>
The light waned after nine o'clock, and the dots and
clusters of spectators decreased upon the roads and thronged
into a black mass about the centre of Jacob Taverner's field.
In the midst two graves had been dug, and beside them, on
trestles, lay two coffins close together.  The lids hid their
contents.  A rope fastened between stakes ran round to
prevent spectators from crowding upon performers.
</p>

<p>
Walter Agg and Peter Lethbridge were among the people.
They smoked their pipes, stood at the ring-side, and joked
with the men about them.
</p>

<p>
"When be the covers to be lifted, so as we shall see the
parties?" asked Lethbridge.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Nathaniel Spry was near and answered.
</p>

<p>
"When the torches are lighted, I believe.  The procession
comes down from the cowshed over there.  It is all
to be done in the old way.  Mr. Huggins and Mr. Churchward
both remember the ceremony in their youth; and
they were able to furnish the particulars.  Wasn't you,
Mr. Churchward?"
</p>

<p>
"I was," said Adam, who stood close at hand.  "In my
boyhood's days much was done that has been since
forgotten.  The common people have a rough sense of poetic
justice.  So has the human race in general.  Jarratt Weekes,
my son-in-law, asked me to be the minister on this occasion
and read the burial service; but I refused, because it was
contrary to the dignity of my age or my calling.  Moreover,
Jarratt will do it himself."
</p>

<p>
"He's the leading spirit, then?" asked Agg.
</p>

<p>
"I am violating no confidence when I answer that he
is," replied Adam.  "He has an active sense of justice&mdash;a
thing specially acute in those who are suffering from
injustice.  I fear we are about to administer a harsh lesson to
some erring brother and sister.  Yet who shall say it won't
be well deserved?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps the parties will," suggested Lethbridge;
"bound to come as an ugly shock to them, no doubt."
</p>

<p>
"You are quite right, my man," declared Nathaniel Spry.
"It is a very tragical thought, isn't it, Mr. Churchward? that
the very people themselves may at this moment be
laughing and joking by these graves, little knowing that
their own effigies are lying within a few yards of them in
those boxes."
</p>

<p>
"A very tragical thought indeed," admitted the schoolmaster.
"So much so, in fact, that I wish we had three
or four more constables here, instead of merely Arthur
Routleigh.  He is a good man enough for keeping order amid
ordinary people; but he might lose his head at a crisis.
However, he has the majesty of the Law behind him."
</p>

<p>
"Jimmery!  There's Joe Tapson!" cried Agg suddenly.
"What the mischief's that on his head?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Tapson, clad in black, with flowing mourning bands
fluttering from an old beaver hat, passed hastily and
disappeared into the cowshed.
</p>

<p>
"He's the undertaker," explained Mr. Spry.  "Everything
is done in the proper way, so that the ceremony may
be solemn and awe-striking.  They wanted Valentine Huggins
to be undertaker, but the old man was frightened to
do anything so prominent.  Then they asked me, but I
had to refuse owing to my official position in Lydford as
postmaster under Government."
</p>

<p>
"There goeth Noah Pearn, with his man and a barrel of
beer," said Lethbridge.  "He'll broach it under the hedge.
Never loses a chance, that chap."
</p>

<p>
The crowd increased and began to grow impatient.  Shouts
were directed to the cowshed, which was now illuminated
brightly from within.  Then Mr. Huggins, in deep black,
against which his white beard shone luminously, came out
and hobbled to the policeman in charge of the ring.
</p>

<p>
"Tell 'em the procession moves at ten o'clock sharp,
will 'e, Arthur?  And mind you have a way cleared through
the people to the graveside, so there shan't be nothing
onseemly done."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Routleigh raised his voice and proclaimed the news.
Then he drove some boys out of the ring.  They had crept
in behind him and were trying to peep under the coffin lids.
</p>

<p>
Not many women were present, though many desired to
be.  Their men in most cases had forbidden them.  Certain
wives, however, who were not under dominion, attended the
rite; and among these stood Mrs. Philip Weekes.  Her
daughter-in-law was beside her and, hidden from them,
Susan Huggins and her gamekeeper also mingled with the
people.
</p>

<p>
"I don't like it, whoever 'tis," declared Hephzibah.
"But since it had to be, I'm here.  To bury the living be
a very terrible piece of work, and I hope to heaven nothing
evil will come of it."
</p>

<p>
"She deserves it, whoever she be," said Jarratt's wife.
</p>

<p>
"You mean you don't know who 'tis?"
</p>

<p>
"Not me, mother."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Weekes sniffed.
</p>

<p>
"It puzzles my spirit to know how a man can keep
anything hidden from his wife.  If I'd been in your shoes,
I'd have got the woman's name, and the man's name too,
out of my husband double quick.  Guy Fawkes and angels!&mdash;who
be they, I should like to know, to keep their
two-penny-halfpenny thoughts from us?  A son's different.
Of course I couldn't make Jarratt tell me.  I wish they'd
get on with it.  The dew be going through my shoes and
chilling me to the knees."
</p>

<p>
The church clock presently struck ten and a wave of
excitement rippled round the rope.  People swept this way
and that, as people will.  Shouts and laughter rose.  The
grass, trampled under many feet, emitted its own odour,
and from the open earth a faint smell came.  The sky was
clear and a few stars twinkled.  Light still hung westward
and the great bulk of Lydford Castle loomed square and
black against it.
</p>

<p>
A dance of many flames suddenly flashed through the grey
gloom of summer night.  The dew answered, and the earth
was streaked and shot with points of fire.  Above the smoky
effulgence of the torches, the sky appeared to grow very
dark.  Everything outside this radiance of orange flame
disappeared and was lost.  Only within the glare the
procession appeared and moved forward&mdash;a medley of lurid lights
and ink black shadows.
</p>

<p>
"They're coming, they're coming!" cried many voices,
and the solitary policeman, opening the rope, struggled to
make a way for them.  Agg, Lethbridge, and others, seeing
his efforts futile, lent their aid, and presently into the ring
the performers slowly came with torches waving above them.
From the shed which they had left there echoed a hollow
reverberation, repeated at intervals of half a minute.  This
represented the lich bell.  A hymn rose as the procession
approached, and the shrill treble voices of six boys singing
together sounded thin and strange under the night.
</p>

<p>
The choir, in long white smocks, led the way.  Then
came six men with torches; and then Mr. Huggins and
Mr. Taverner appeared as mourners.  More torches followed,
and Jarratt Weekes next played his part in a parson's gown
with a broad black stole hung over it.  On one side of him
walked a boy with a book; on the other side a boy carried a
tall candle.  The huge shape of the 'Infant' in black, with
a hat-band streaming behind him, followed; and at his side
walked Joe Tapson, similarly attired.  The disparity in their
sizes created much merriment.
</p>

<p>
Into the ring they came.  The boys took their places
between the graves; the men stuck their torches into sconces
arranged for them upon poles.
</p>

<p>
Then attention was paid to the coffins.  Jarratt opened
the book and the boy with the big candle held it aloft, so
that the light fell upon the page.  All was done with absolute
order and decorum.  The spectators, not the performers,
threatened to break the peace.  A great sheaf of light rose
up into the darkness; a babel of voices echoed.  Laughter
and shouts resounded round the ring, and under the flickering
fire the people searched each other's faces and called
out greetings.  An effect impish and demonian danced upon
every countenance.  Flame and darkness played at
hood-man-blind together, and now features were distorted, and now
whole bodies loomed huge or shrank and shrivelled under
the light.  Mrs. Weekes observed this sinister transformation.
</p>

<p>
"Never seed such a shocking sight," she said to Philip.
</p>

<p>
"We'm like a ring of evil apes.  'Tis a flouting of religion
to play these tricks with it, and I wish I'd not been such a
fool as to come.  To see us, you'd think 'twas Bostock's
wild beasts, not Lydford, had broke loose.  Just look at
the awful shape Adam Churchward cuts!"
</p>

<p>
"He don't look worse than he feels, if 'tis with him as
it is with me," answered Philip.
</p>

<p>
Elsewhere Agg spoke to Lethbridge.
</p>

<p>
"Can you mark Brendon?  He was coming up a thought
before ten o'clock from the station, and he promised to look
out for us.  I'm afraid he'll miss the fun."
</p>

<p>
"Can't see him; but he may be here," answered Peter.
"Look at Jacob Taverner.  I'll die of laughing in a
minute.  The toad's pretending to cry!"
</p>

<p>
Jarratt Weekes at this moment shouted for peace.  Then
Joe Tapson and William Churchward approached the coffin-lids,
while a very real silence fell as the dolls were revealed.
The creator's heart beat fast under his great bosom.  He
hungered to hear a shout of instant recognition; and indeed
this was not long delayed.
</p>

<p>
With a ghostly semblance of life the effigies stared out,
and the feet of the coffins were lowered so that all might
see.  The throng massed in front of the show, and the
ringside behind the performers was left empty.
</p>

<p>
What the people saw was a long, thin doll in riding
breeches, Norfolk jacket, and hard hat.  It stared out with
sunken, sallow cheeks, and the torchlight played upon its
life-size, life-like body.  In the other coffin lay the female
doll, and her tow hair was drawn back from her forehead
and her red lips smiled.  The face had been most carefully
modelled and painted; therefore its resemblance to Sarah
Jane Brendon was clear to all who knew her.
</p>

<p>
"God's light! what's this?" Lethbridge asked loudly;
but Agg did not answer.
</p>

<p>
A great murmur shook the throng.  Names were cried
back and forward.  A few laughed, some already shouted
angrily for the mummery to cease.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis Sarah Jane and Hilary Woodrow&mdash;sure as I'm a
sinful man," said Philip Weekes to his wife.
</p>

<p>
She did not answer, but glared at the figures.
</p>

<p>
Several voices cried out "Sarah Jane Brendon!"  Others
remembered the vanished farmer and named him.  A spirit
decidedly averse from the performers was apparent in the
crowd, and Philip Weekes voiced it.
</p>

<p>
"This is a damned, wicked, wanton shame!" he roared
out; "and I say it, though my own son's mixed in it."
</p>

<p>
"Order&mdash;order!" yelled a voice or two.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Huggins tried to get out of the ring, but was drawn
back by the Infant.  Mr. Churchward and Mr. Spry among
the spectators also showed fear, and the latter, feeling that
the sooner he departed from Thornyside the better for his
reputation, set out to do so.  Adam, in much concern,
followed him.  Jarratt Weekes, unmoved, proceeded grimly
with the service as long as he could be heard.  He had
seen what none else had as yet; he had marked where the
great form of Daniel Brendon suddenly reared itself behind
the crowd.  His voice shook at the sight, but he proceeded&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time
to live and is full of misery.  He cometh up and is
cut&mdash;&mdash;'"
</p>

<p>
Then shouts drowned his voice and a resolute and angry
faction got over the rope with intent to stop the proceedings.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Taverner was appealed to by Jarratt Weekes.
</p>

<p>
"Stop 'em&mdash;stop 'em!&mdash;they can't interfere.  This is
private land!" he shouted.
</p>

<p>
But Jacob had gone over to the other side.
</p>

<p>
"If I'd known who it was&mdash;&mdash;" he began, and stripped
his mourning band off his hat.
</p>

<p>
At this sign the ring was broken up; a torch fell here and
there and illuminated the open graves; then, like the sudden
charge of some great beast, Brendon, who had at last
understood, ploughed through the people and cast them to right
and left.  In another moment his hand was on the collar
of Jarratt Weekes.  With one sweep of his arm he tore
the surplice off; then he dashed the book aside; and then
he shook the mummer till Jarratt screamed and an answering
scream came from his mother.
</p>

<p>
"Speak," said Daniel.  "Tell me why you've done
this; and tell me why I shouldn't let the life out of you
for doing it!"
</p>

<p>
"Let go my neck, then," answered the other.  Then he
shouted to the people, "Why don't you pull this fool away?
D'you want to see me killed?"
</p>

<p>
"Sarve you right," cried a dozen voices.  "We'd do
the like if we was the husband!"
</p>

<p>
"Speak!" repeated Brendon.  His eyes burnt redder
than the flames of the torch-fires round him.
</p>

<p>
"Then I will.  I've done this thing because it was true.
Ask John Prout.  True afore the living God; and may He
blast me, and strike me with all the curses of hell for all
eternity now and for evermore if it ban't true.  True!&mdash;ask
Prout&mdash;ask them we've mimicked here&mdash;they'll not
deny it!"
</p>

<p>
He pointed to the puppets staring mildly up at their
makers.
</p>

<p>
For a moment Brendon held off and glared round him.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you believe the filthy liar, Dan!" bellowed Agg
from the crowd.
</p>

<p>
"Let God strike me blind and mad now afore the people
if it's not true.  Prout saw it&mdash;with his own eyes he saw
it.  Kill me if you like&mdash;but it's true&mdash;true as the Bible is
true&mdash;and you'll live to know it," cried Weekes; and his
grim earnestness appeared to affect the principal listener.
</p>

<p>
Ignorant of what was doing, the boy in the shed still
struck an old iron bin to imitate a passing bell.  The sound
acted on the people as a drum on a dervish.  Brendon stood
irresolute.
</p>

<p>
"Fling the beastly man into one of them graves and that
big, fat fool after him!" shouted a voice.
</p>

<p>
There was a rush for Weekes and William Churchward.
Mud and stones were flung, and a clod struck Jarratt in the
mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Let him go&mdash;don't be cowards&mdash;let the man take his
folly away!" cried Hephzibah shrilly; but none listened.
Amid roars and shouts the mob surrounded Weekes and the
younger Churchward.  Joe Tapson and the choir boys were
kicked heartily; Mr. Huggins had escaped in time, and
now lurked behind a distant hedge and waited trembling
to see what might happen.  The people next threw the dolls
out of their coffins, trod their putty faces into pulp and
played football with their limbs.  A man embraced the
female figure amid roars of laughter.  Then he danced
with it.
</p>

<p>
Half a dozen resolute labourers dragged the Infant into
one grave; while others, including a private enemy or two,
tied Weekes within an empty coffin and lowered him into
the second pit.
</p>

<p>
The passing bell still boomed on.  Then the policeman,
whose efforts towards maintaining peace were vain, did a
definite thing, rushed up to the cowshed and stopped it.
</p>

<p>
Elsewhere Noah Pearn suffered.  He had been standing
rather anxiously beside his beer barrel, until some reckless
spirits discovered the drink, and summoned others.  Then
Pearn was thrust into a ditch without ceremony, and his
liquor consumed under the darkness.  Many of the men
present had come for miles, and those who belonged to the
neighbourhood cared nothing for the publican's threats.  They
drank and presently emptied the barrel.  Then a few
intoxicated jesters began to throw earth on Weekes and William
Churchward, and it was not until the parents of the two
sufferers summoned aid and resolutely attacked the reckless
party, that Jarratt and the bruised and battered Infant were
rescued.
</p>

<p>
The torches expired and the folk at last departed.  They
left nothing to mark the event but a torn and trampled
field, the dismembered limbs of the puppets, and the
shattered timbers of their coffins.
</p>

<p>
Dawn found these things in their hideousness, and it also
rose upon two men deep in conversation together.  Agg and
Lethbridge, appreciating the gravity of the position, had
hurried home that some preparation for Daniel's coming
might be made.  But he did not come.  They waited ready
to intercept him and learn his mood and his intentions; then
night passed and morning failed to bring him.  Therefore
they guessed that he must have followed the word of Jarratt
Weekes literally, and turned his face to the sea that he
might speak with Prout.  They scorned the story, and
dared not name it at Ruddyford.  But at the earliest
opportunity they despatched a telegram to Prout from Mary Tavy
and warned him that he must stand between Daniel Brendon
and the master.
</p>

<p>
"He'll soon calm the man down, if 'tis false, as it must
be," said Agg.  "Pray God no note of this gets to Sarah
Jane's ears; yet that's a vain hope, for everybody on
Dartymoor will be chattering of it inside twelve hours."
</p>

<p>
"I'm thinking of the man," answered Lethbridge.  "If
'tis false, he'll have the hide off Jarratt Weekes for this
night's work; and if 'twas true, he wouldn't stop short
of&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"'True'!  Who that have ever met that clean, fearless
creature would dare say it?  Prout will calm the man down;
but Lord pity them who get within reach of Brendon's rage
when he goes into Lydford again."
</p>

<p>
"He may have believed it, however, and gone from that
field and hanged himself," argued Lethbridge.
</p>

<p>
"Never!  Would he wrong his wife like that&mdash;or Mr. Woodrow
either?  No, he ban't the sort to let a lie change
him.  This blackguard thing calls to be answered, and
these insulted people will answer it."
</p>

<p>
"Daniel will for 'em, more likely.  Master's so good as
buried in real earnest and far beyond fighting; and as for
Sarah Jane, 'tis her husband's part to make her name and
fame sweet afore the nation."
</p>

<p>
"Which he will do&mdash;have no fear of that," answered
Walter Agg.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
At an early hour they despatched their telegram and
Prout received it.  Half guessing the truth, he waited in
fearful anxiety; but Brendon did not come.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0313"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br><br>
ANOTHER EFFIGY
</h3>

<p>
From the pandemonium of the mock burial Daniel Brendon
took himself unseen.  The advice of Jarratt Weekes
appeared to be reasonable, and he decided to follow it.  He
was told to ask Prout, and he determined to do so.  He
roamed through darkness, and the past turned back like a
scroll, and he read into the recent years far more than Prout
could tell him.  It was not possible to reach Dawlish until
the following day, and long before the summer dawn
returned Brendon had passed beyond thought of Prout to
that of his master.
</p>

<p>
Under deep and silent woods, by waste places and along
lonely roads he went.  The voices of night whispered round
him, and sleeping trees sighed, shivered, and slept again
as he passed them by.  Nocturnal creatures were his
companions; the solitary hare limped along before him; the
owl and the night-jar cried from the wood; once he passed
a colony of glow-worms, where they twinkled in the dewy
grass, like a tiny constellation.
</p>

<p>
His mind suffered the gigantic convulsion proper to this
blow.  Within one hour of leaving Lydford, he believed.
His inherent instincts, smothered through five years by
kindness, hushed by gentle words, lulled by immense
generosity, tore their way through these artifices and saw
all that had been hidden, and far more.  The goodness of
Woodrow rotted as Daniel thought of it; and even his
conversion stank.  Brendon saw himself hoodwinked, laughed
at, deceived&mdash;seduced, like a child, with sugar-plums,
rendered harmless with gifts, muzzled and deluded with
fields and beasts and great possessions.  He had worshipped
and obeyed his God for this; he had sung praises to the
Almighty, and toiled in the ways of righteousness for this.
The Everlasting had watched it all, had listened to his
prayers, had marked his mighty efforts, had waited until
the cup was full before striking it from the lip of His
servant.  Brendon turned from God to man, thought upon
his enemy, and considered the plot that had robbed him
of his honour.  Not until the light of dawn awoke upon a
world of young green and silver dew, did Sarah Jane enter
into his mind; and then he determined with himself that
she must stand beside her paramour.  He could not remotely
guess at the truth of the past five years; it was natural
that he should conceive a web of heartless and cruel
deception woven from their united cunning and daily wrapped
closer about himself.  They knew him so well: his weak
spots were so familiar to them, that the rest was easy.
They had laughed at his complacent and devout trust in God
a thousand times; doubtless they had grown accustomed
to their sin and finally become careless.  It was natural
that all the world should know before it fell upon his ears.
He read the whole story; he saw Woodrow handing over
the farm in exchange for what he wanted more; he imagined
Sarah Jane making the bargain.  Anon Woodrow pretended
to Christianity and Sarah Jane also affected an attitude of
increased prayer and devotion.  All was dust&mdash;dust flung
by cruel hands and hard hearts to blind him.
</p>

<p>
His life crashed down, like a tree thrown in March.  So
had he seen a great elm fall.  One moment it stood in full and
glorious dignity of adult growth, the sun upon its crown
and rosy inflorescence of flowers meshed within a grey
mist of the young twigs; then the saw gnawed to its
heart, the axe rang, the mallet drove the wedge, and the
whole mighty edifice, falling in thunder, lay crushed fiat
by its own weight, maimed, wrecked, shattered, and utterly
destroyed.  Only a raw disc in the hedge marked the place
whence it had sprung upward, to be a theatre for the
loveliness of spring and autumn, a home for the storm-thrush,
a harp for the winter wind.
</p>

<p>
Now the fabric of his fortunes similarly collapsed, and he
found all that had looked so healthy was flourishing upon
foundations of putrescence and decay.  No canker had eaten
into his life and ruined it; no sudden misfortune had grown
and turned what was fair to what was foul; but, in
ignorance, with immense labour, he had built upon
stark fraud and filth and his own dishonour; he had
founded his life on falsehoods and sins; he had worshipped
his God in unconsciousness of the truth; he had been drawn
to closer and deeper intercourse with Christ through the
cold-blooded villainy of a man.  His ambitions, aims and
future schemes were all rooted and flourishing in his own
betrayal; and his God had suffered this appalling thing to
come to pass, and denied him one dim hint or whisper of
the truth.  At the crucial moment, when Woodrow made
him his heir, the Almighty had blinded Daniel's native
instinct and not permitted even a suspicion of reality to
be associated with the gift.  All had combined against him;
all had cozened his understanding: his wife, his master, his
God.  Man and Heaven had united to deceive him; and
man, knowing the truth, had watched his sustained devotion
and faith; and Heaven, knowing the truth, had accepted
his worship and thanksgiving, had suffered his delusion to
continue, had planned the horror of the end.
</p>

<p>
Every wind of the night came to him with a new grief;
every scent of the night brought a new agony; every voice
of the night drove home the truth with an added torment.
He looked up at the stars and asked them what he should
do.  From force of habit he knelt and called upon God.
But he remembered that, in this matter, God was on the side
of the enemy.  Therefore he rose and went forward without
prayer.
</p>

<p>
By morning he had walked many miles along the foothills
of the Moor; and then, after five o'clock, he went
down to a railway station, waited for the first train, and
travelled to Plymouth.  He suffered himself to rest there
for a time; and he washed and ate.  Henceforth he was
concerned with Hilary Woodrow and not with John Prout.
He perceived clearly that the old man, who would have
sacrificed his soul for Hilary, had helped his wife and
Woodrow against him.  He retraced events of many journeys.
He thought of the days that he had been from home,
and of the time spent by his wife at Dawlish.  He forged
a long and dreadful chain of horrible deceits that had never
existed.  He began to imagine an evil story which occupied
a place in time long after the actual treachery was over
and done.  Upon the fact of his betrayal he built a mighty
monument; yet this memorial had itself scarcely any existence
in fact.  That, however, mattered little.  The truth
without addition had been enough for Brendon.
</p>

<p>
Day was turned to night in his mind, and he longed for
the real night, that he might accomplish his purpose.  About
noon he took train to Dawlish, and reached it before three
o'clock.
</p>

<p>
He bought bread and ate it to support himself; then he
went into the woods above the town and lurked there until
the dark.  His decision was come to, and he intended to
destroy both Woodrow and Sarah Jane.  They should
perish; and at that moment he would have killed his God
too if he had known how.  For a short time, indeed, his
fetich was dead enough; because to find what he had believed
a Creator's sustained and benignant attention proved
instead one cruel, long-drawn trick and jest, shook the
man to the roots of his faith.  Such action seemed not
compatible with any conception of a loving, a just, and an
all-powerful father.
</p>

<p>
For an hour he cursed God like a fallen Titan; but only
for an hour.  Then lifelong trust and faith conquered, and
even at this crisis atrophied reason proved too weak to grasp
its opportunity.  Faith re-took the citadel.  He reflected
upon his Bible, and presently perceived that nothing had
happened to him which was contrary to the common way of
God with man.  The Jehovah he adored; He who once
drowned every little child in the whole world; the Being
who led Israel into the desert of Sinai; who slew Uzzah for
steadying His ark; who killed seventy thousand innocent
men because David numbered his people; who commanded
whole nations to be slaughtered and their virgins only saved
for the conquerors; who prescribed rules for slavery; who
destroyed the firstborn of all Egypt, and tore ten thousand
mothers' hearts; who loved the stench and smear of blood
upon His altars, and pursued His foes with the tenacity,
cruelty and craft of a Red Indian&mdash;this Everlasting Spirit
might most reasonably be expected to play the faithless
savage and torture even the least of those who worshipped
His omnipotent name.  But it was not for his creature to
question Him; it was not for a thinking being to spurn this
almighty pest with scorn and with loathing; it was not for
a smitten man to ask how any Prince of Devils could worse
confound his own creation.
</p>

<p>
Brendon offered the other cheek; and before he stole out
from his hiding-place in the forest and went down where
Woodrow dwelt, he was safe in the grip of his God once
more.  The fact, however, did not alter his determination,
because this revelation of his own ordained ruin and
destruction brought others in its train.  Subsequent actions
were clearly indicated to him by the Being he still obeyed;
for Daniel was not wholly sane now.  Streaks and flashes
of madness touched the tissue of his thoughts, as sparks
fly in smoke.  Barriers fell, old orderly opinions perished,
strangled by the horde of ferocious ideas that hurtled through
his mind.  From the broken links of dead principles a new
thing was welded, and method and purpose were restored.
He believed in predestination, and through that hypothesis
he came back humbly to the footstool of his idol.  He
perceived that the World-maker had chosen him to drive the
knife into these evil hearts.  For that purpose, the infinitely
wise, infinitely just, infinitely loving God of his fathers
had called him from the womb; had suffered him to live
and thrive; had ordered his life prosperously; had taught
him from his youth up to worship Heaven, and walk
uprightly before men.  To this end his faith had been founded
upon adamant, and tempered to move mountains; to this
end the Sun of Righteousness had warmed his spirit; and
now the fruit of his spirit was about to ripen in murder.
</p>

<p>
For a time the natural rage that consumed him cooled a
little before these high mandates.  The inversion of his
intellect was complete; and though there came to him a fear
that he was about to do this thing that he might gratify
a personal lust and hunger for revenge, he put that temptation
away as of the Devil.  He believed that the powers of
darkness urged him to spare his wife and his master; while
Jehovah ordered their instant death.  To let them live now
would be to frustrate their Maker's plan&mdash;a thing unthinkable.
He longed for a Bible that he might wallow in the
atrocities of the Pentateuch and find wherewithal to
strengthen his arm there.
</p>

<p>
He was very nearly insane at this crisis&mdash;madder than
it happens to most to be at any time.  Yet few there are,
capable of intense feeling, who have not stood at the veil,
looked behind it in dreams or calentures, and seen the
red-eyed spirit glare like a gorgon out.  She peers forth by
night, and the dreaming brain knows her well; at times of
terrific joy or grief she is near; after physical excesses
she comes close; surfeit or starvation alike summon her;
she is the firstling of superstition, the familiar of the fanatic.
</p>

<p>
This man walked with madness that night for a little
time, and not until he had returned to the lamp-lit streets
did the unholy thing depart from him.  Then he affirmed
his spirit, prayed fervent prayers, and tramped by the sea
a while, before going upon his business.  He meant to kill
Woodrow with his naked hands.
</p>

<p>
Before the row of dwellings wherein the sick man lay,
Daniel became puzzled, for he had forgotten the house.  It
was only by chance that he rang at the right one.
</p>

<p>
Some time elapsed before any answer came; then the
door opened upon darkness, and Brendon did not know that
it was Prout who stood before him.
</p>

<p>
"Who bides here?" he asked, and his voice startled him,
for the tone was strange.
</p>

<p>
"Death, my son," answered the other.
</p>

<p>
Brendon pushed the old man aside, strode in, and then
found that John told the truth.
</p>

<p>
Hilary Woodrow lay in his bed.  The room was lighted
by a gas chandelier, but only one jet burnt there.  Brendon's
mind leapt over the abysses of the last four-and-twenty
hours.
</p>

<p>
"This is not him," he said.  "You've dragged that doll
back again to deceive me!"
</p>

<p>
"He died afore noon to-day, and yours was the last name
on his lips in this world.  Maybe the first in the next."
</p>

<p>
"Let him scream it in hell&mdash;the blasted, faithless villain!
Dead&mdash;he's not dead&mdash;he knows what I'm here for&mdash;he's
foxing now, as he has foxed me all his life&mdash;foul, heartless,
godless monster that he was!"
</p>

<p>
"Daniel&mdash;Daniel&mdash;for God's sake&mdash;a dead man, Daniel!"
</p>

<p>
"Out on his death and out on you, you go-between!  To
hold my hand and swear friends, and help them into each
other's arms behind my back&mdash;God of light and reason! why
be such rank poison as you allowed to&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
He broke off and stared where the colourless clay of his
master gazed blankly up&mdash;just as the doll had gazed.
Insolence seemed to sit on the dust&mdash;the insolence of a mean
spirit that had narrowly escaped harm and now, in safety,
turned to jeer.  Brendon roared and cursed the corpse, while
Prout implored him to be sane.
</p>

<p>
"This happened five years ago and more," cried the old
man; "'twas all over then for ever."
</p>

<p>
"All over&mdash;for them it might have been.  What of
me? ... All over but the payment....  What of me, I
say? ... Blight his dim, damned eyes&mdash;blight him lying
there and telling the truth with his dumb lips now he's safe
from me....  What of me?  'All ended'!  It's only
begun for me.  The reaping's mine&mdash;the reaping of this
devil's crop.  Mine to put in God's sickle now!"
</p>

<p>
"Nought but the whirlwind will you reap, poor man.
Turn to your God, and don't blaspheme Him.  Call on
Him, afore you do what can't be undone.  For pity, Daniel&mdash;for
pity.  He's gone to answer for what he did.  Leave
her to God too."
</p>

<p>
The man grew calmer and reflected before answering.
</p>

<p>
"Mine's a difficult God, you must know," he said.
"He's come between again.  Only vengeance be God's,
but justice belongs to us seemingly.  This wasn't justice&mdash;to
let that lying adulterer slip away in peace like he has!
I comed to strangle him, and God's stepped between
again&mdash;robbed me again.  'Tis almost more than a faithful soldier
and servant can endure, John Prout.  Job's self wasn't called
to face a thing like this.  I've been deserted, look you, for
no fault of my own.  Robbed&mdash;robbed of all my earnings,
and my honour, and my hopes."
</p>

<p>
He was silent a moment, then rage broke bounds again.
</p>

<p>
"Let Him take care&mdash;let Him that's reigning above
Heaven take care, else one more soul will be damned.  He
can steal everything from me but hell; but that's in all
men's reach.  We can rob Him of our immortal souls!
That's in my power, and why not?  What's Heaven to me
now?  I'd rather follow this devil down&mdash;down&mdash;if 'tis
only to hunt and harry him through raging fire for
evermore! ... Even that I'll do ... when she's gone.  Evil for
evil will I pay my God, and choose my portion with them
that ruined me!"
</p>

<p>
"Man, man&mdash;I implore you by my grey hairs, Daniel!"
</p>

<p>
"Curse your grey hairs! who are you to squeak?  You
helped this man to hell&mdash;you know it!  Cold he be now&mdash;but
he'll roast for it for ever; and may it be mine to
trample him into the hot eye of the fire, till he's red
through, and the marrow runs out of his damned bones!
Why is he dead&mdash;why is he dead now?  I was his
death&mdash;fashioned by the Almighty's plan to be his death&mdash;born
to be his death.  Bring him back!  Bring him back!  Be
the God of Ages a fool to let all His planning and plotting
fall to nought?  Who is Death to stand grinning between
me and this filthy clay?  Be he stronger than the God that
conquered him?  Curse him, and curse heaven and hell
that's caught this man away from me in his last hour."
</p>

<p>
Now he seemed to realize the other's absolute escape;
and he lifted his voice, howled horribly, turned upon the
dead, and struck Woodrow's forehead.
</p>

<p>
Thereupon Prout flung himself at Brendon with all his
weak might, and cried shame, and called upon him to be
a man and not a beast.  But Daniel swept him off and went
out.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br><br>
THE LONELY ALTARS
</h3>

<p>
Before noon on the day after Hilary Woodrow's death
two men advanced towards Ruddyford farm.  One went
slowly on foot; the other rode as hard as his horse could
carry him.  While Brendon climbed White Hill and stopped
for several minutes beside the cairns upon its summit,
Jarratt Weekes leapt off his horse at the farmyard gate and
hurried into the house.
</p>

<p>
He had learnt that Brendon was returning home from
Lydford station, and he had instantly set out to go before
him and give Sarah Jane warning.  Not, however, until his
arrival at Ruddyford did he realize the whole truth or
appreciate the effects of his recent action.
</p>

<p>
It was Sarah Jane herself who told him, and his terror
at the recital contrasted forcibly with her calmness.
</p>

<p>
"Agg broke all to me yesterday," she said.  "My husband
went to Dawlish to kill Woodrow.  I want no words
with you, nor any other man now.  You can't alter what's
got to be."
</p>

<p>
"For God's sake let me save you!" he implored.  "'Tis
murder on my soul for ever if he does you any hurt."
</p>

<p>
"See you to that," she said; then she turned to Tabitha
Prout.  "I know my way clear enough.  The man's on
the road.  When he comes, you can tell him that I be gone
up-along to the peat works, and have taken the boy with
me.  He'll understand."
</p>

<p>
She left them and went to her own cottage.  There she
took a pencil and wrote a few words on a piece of paper.
The brief letter she folded up, put into an envelope, and
addressed to Daniel.  Next she called her child.
</p>

<p>
"Us be going up to the peat works, Gregory.  Come along
quick, my pretty."
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!" said he; and as soon as Sarah Jane had
put on her sun-bonnet, they started over the Moor for Great
Links.  Her letter was in her pocket.  She knew that her
husband must presently appear on the summit of White
Hill; and from that point he could not fail to see her.
She understood why he had come, and what he would do.
No shadow of fear for herself clouded her understanding
now.  She perceived very fully what this terrific discovery
must mean to Brendon, and unutterable grief for him was
at her heart.  Hilary had escaped, and she was thankful,
both for Daniel and the dead.  Now she went up through
the unspeakable glories of a cloudless June day; and
sometimes her hand tightened on the hand of her child.
</p>

<p>
Below, Agg, Weekes, and Lethbridge held earnest converse.
The terror of Jarratt made the others contemptuous.
"Give over shouting out to your God, you dirty cur,"
said Walter Agg.  "Well may you shake in your shoes.
If yonder man, as be coming now, was sane and not mad,
'tis you that he'd put out of the way, and I could hope
that he will do so yet.  To betray her&mdash;you blasted
rogue!  You'll be damned afore any of us for it&mdash;that's one
comfort."
</p>

<p>
"'Twas never meant to turn to this&mdash;God's my judge, I
didn't foresee any such thing."
</p>

<p>
"Get out of honest men's eyes and hang yourself, like
the Judas you be.  I would break your head this moment
and rejoice in it, if I hadn't to keep my strength for yonder
man."
</p>

<p>
"I can do no more," said Weekes.  "I call you to
witness that I comed here afore him to warn her.  She
might have escaped him if she chose to do it."
</p>

<p>
"Where be she now?" asked Lethbridge, and Tabitha
Prout spoke.
</p>

<p>
"She went to her own house, so soon as she heard
Daniel was on the way."
</p>

<p>
Weekes returned into the yard, where his horse stood.
Then he pointed to the hill.
</p>

<p>
"He cometh!"
</p>

<p>
On the cairn, motionless, stood Brendon.  They watched
him, and presently he began to descend.  Jarratt Weekes
rode away.  Agg took off his coat and tightened his belt.
</p>

<p>
"Be you going to help me withstand that man, Peter?"
he asked calmly; but Lethbridge refused.
</p>

<p>
"No, I ban't," he answered.  "I'll die in my bed a
few years hence for choice.  This be none of my business.
You know him.  The man of common strength that stands
between him and her now will be broken for it.  She might
have been saved, but she wouldn't be, an' there's an end."
</p>

<p>
The great moment in Walter Agg's life had come.
</p>

<p>
"Broken, or not broken, I'll do what I can," he said.
</p>

<p>
They looked up the hill again to see that Daniel Brendon
no longer approached them.  He had caught sight of Sarah
Jane far away, and already near the summit of Great Links.
Instantly he changed his course, and proceeded directly over
the Moor toward her.
</p>

<p>
Seeking the reason of his action, Agg and Lethbridge also
marked Sarah Jane, now above a mile away on the heights.
</p>

<p>
"God Almighty, she's run for it&mdash;too late!" cried
Lethbridge; but Agg had already left him.  He knew that he
could cut off Brendon, and started to do so.  They met far
below Great Links, and by the time that they did so Sarah
Jane had already reached the summit.  She sat there for a
space, took her farewell of the world, drank her last draught
of the glory of the summer sun and the splendour of the
summer earth.
</p>

<p>
Like a dream picture painted in milk and gold, rich with
magic light even in the pearly shadows, overflowing with
the lustre and fervour of June, Devon spread before her feet
and rolled in sunlit leagues to the horizons of the sea.
There lacked no gracious beauty proper to that scene.  It
rose beyond perfection to sublimity, lifted her watching
spirit higher than any praise; begot the serene, still sadness
that reigns above all joy.
</p>

<p>
The mundane matter of Brendon's meeting with Agg
interested her but little.  Like the struggle of two ants it
seemed in the midst of that huge loneliness.  She saw the
figures run together and turn and twist a moment.  Then
the lesser was shot violently away and fell sprawling.  The
prone atom writhed for a second and was still; the other
came on.
</p>

<p>
"Poor Walter!" thought Sarah Jane.
</p>

<p>
Her heart throbbed farewell to the only world she had
known; and, gazing upward, she was glad that the sky shone
blue over her death.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
As Daniel Brendon stood and gazed upon Ruddyford from
the barrows of White Hill, he had suddenly recollected
two former occasions when the distant farm spread before
him with special significance.  His first vision of it in storm
came to his mind, and he remembered how that he had
descended, and entered into the life of the place, and toiled
mightily to advance the welfare of the farm and its master.
Then came the moment when, fresh from reading Hilary
Woodrow's will, he had gazed upon the land of promise
and, by slow stages, grasped the tremendous truth that all
he saw within these boundaries would presently be his own.
Vividly he remembered that occasion, and how, lifted by the
actual spectacle of Ruddyford, he had turned back again
to the giver and renewed his gratitude.  And now he looked
upon his own, and called on his God to shatter it with
lightning, to burn it with fire, to bury it and blot it out,
like the cities of the plain.  He hungered to be at the work,
to tear its foundations from their granite roots, to blast the
bed it lay on, to leave no trace upon earth by which man
might remember it.
</p>

<p>
He moved a little way onward; then suddenly saw the
woman and child.  He stopped, shielded his eyes from the
light and recognized them.  The man felt glad that she
understood why he had come.  It was better to make an end
up aloft on the lonely altars, than within the cursed confines
of the farm.  He knew that she was going to the
peat-works; that she understood his coming.  His mind was
calm now and steadfastly settled to destroy her.  He changed
his course and proceeded leisurely towards Great Links.
Already he said to himself that Sarah Jane should sleep
beside her father and die where he died.
</p>

<p>
Then ran Walter Agg and stood against him and tried to
stay him.  The battle between them was not of long duration,
and to the weaker man happened what Lethbridge foretold.
He was flung down with terrific violence; he fell upon a
rock and his leg was broken.  Brendon left him there
without any word and went on to the great hill.  Presently he
stopped, looked upward to the grey forehead of the tor,
and he noted that his wife was sitting quietly there,
watching him.  Only then his soul sickened, and he found it in
his heart to call upon God to spare her.  For she sat very
near the spot where first they had loved and worshipped
each other.  He hesitated, but strode on again; and
presently she rose and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
A track over the heavy fens between the tor and the
peat-works was known to Sarah Jane, and now she followed it,
while her child ran on before.
</p>

<p>
Soon they entered the familiar ruin and took their way to
the great drum.  There, in dead heath and fern, little
Gregory rested awhile; then he called for his favourite toy.
</p>

<p>
"Not yet, my dicky-bird," she said.  "You've got
something to do for mother first.  Look over there&mdash;down
to the end of the path&mdash;who be that coming after us?"
</p>

<p>
The child uttered an exclamation of surprise and pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"Daddy!  Daddy back home again!" he said.
</p>

<p>
"So it is, then.  And I've got a letter here that you must
take to him.  Such a man you be now!  Here 'tis&mdash;you
run down along with it and tell him mother's sent it.
Quick!  How fast he's walking!"
</p>

<p>
She gave her child the letter and a long kiss.  After that
he trotted off to meet his father.
</p>

<p>
Sarah Jane watched him; then turned and took his toy
from its hiding-place.  It was the famous old knife which
she had seen so often in her father's hand.  The blade was
blunt, but that mattered not, for her Roman spirit turned
to the point.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis my heart did wrong," she said; "'tis my heart&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The child ran to Brendon and jumped into his arms, as
he was wont to do.
</p>

<p>
"A letter from mother, daddy," he cried; "I've carried
it safe for 'e."
</p>

<p>
Deep soul movements had swept Daniel as he climbed to
the crowns of the land.  He began to ask himself questions;
his heart shook and bled within him; he prayed to his God;
he humbly implored his God; but no answer came.
Therefore he went onward&mdash;since the Almighty's mind was
unshaken.  Then came the child, and he took the letter
and doubted not that the Father of Mercy had, even at this
last hour, dictated it to her who sent it.  Now he was to
learn what he must do.  While he opened it he walked on,
until he had reached within fifty yards of the ruin.
</p>

<p>
After he had read it, he stood still a moment and
considered.  He doubted not that his wife's eyes were upon
him.
</p>

<p>
The letter was very short:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"<i>My dear, they say you have come.  I know.  I'll spare
you that.&mdash;Your true love.</i>"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The man lifted his voice at last.
</p>

<p>
"I can't do it&mdash;God forgive me, I can't&mdash;I can't.  Make
your peace with Him, as I shall.  Live out your life on
your knees for ever, as I shall.  I'm going.  You shall
never see me no more."
</p>

<p>
Then he spoke to the child.
</p>

<p>
"Get to your mother," he said.
</p>

<p>
Gregory, frightened at his face and voice, ran back as
fast as he could go, and Brendon departed.  But a moment
later, when shrill shriek upon shriek cut his ears, he stopped,
turned again, and went to his child; because he knew that
the little thing was alone.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0315"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br><br>
SET OF MOON
</h3>

<p>
On a night at mid-December, in a darkened room, Daniel
Brendon sat writing laboriously.  The candle beside him was
shielded so that the light should fall only on his papers,
on a copy of the "War Cry," and on his Bible.  In a
corner were two beds, side by side, and his boy occupied
the smaller one and slept peacefully there.  Upon a chair
by the little bed Gregory's clean clothes were placed for
the morrow.  A small scarlet jersey hung close by, and
beside it a very large one, that Daniel would wear.
</p>

<p>
Brendon had joined the Salvation Army and was captain
of the Lydford Branch.  Indeed, he had founded this
branch, and worked like a giant by night and day to
increase its strength.  Twenty-five persons were already
numbered.
</p>

<p>
He rose up and stretched his arms; then sat down and
read through the notes that he had made.  To-morrow the
man would preach from the twelfth chapter of Job and the
twenty-second verse.
</p>

<p>
"He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and
bringeth out to light the shadow of death."
</p>

<p>
The child laughed in his sleep and then was still again.
A clock struck four.
</p>

<p>
Brendon appeared to be much aged; he did not spare
himself in his unceasing struggles for his God.  Only at
such moments as this, in the waste of night, when life's
pulses burned low; when his own agony surged high; when
human powerlessness to stem the tide of the world's grief
was most borne in upon his spirit, did he waver and look
forward hungrily to the end.  For a moment now he put
his great hands over his face and longed for the time when
the dust of the workshop should be still, the dust of the
workman at rest.
</p>

<p>
John Prout and his sister received all Woodrow's money&mdash;a
sum sufficient for their needs until life's end.  Brendon
had sold Ruddyford; and the payment, in shape of notes,
he burnt.  Now he fought under the banner of the new sect
that already foreshadowed its coming power.
</p>

<p>
He rose presently, gazed upon the night and started at
what he saw.
</p>

<p>
"Blood and Fire in heaven too!" he thought.
</p>

<p>
Behind the mass of Lydford castle a moon, just short of
fall, was sinking amid vast clouds.  Some were very dark
and some were luminous; some, while circled with flame,
yet moved in masses unutterably black.  The firmament
seemed troubled by this conflagration.  The setting moon,
surrendering her silver, took upon her bosom the tinctures
of earth; and the stormy clouds burnt with her stained
radiance.  Above them the light exhaled and shot upward
into heaven, where stars shone through the vaporous floor
of the sky.  Orion wheeled his far-flung glories westward
and followed the red moon.
</p>

<p>
The wonder of this silent and nocturnal pageant endured
awhile; then it slowly died away.  The planet flashed a
farewell ruby above the edge of the world, and dreamless
darkness brooded upon earth for a little space before the
dawn.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
